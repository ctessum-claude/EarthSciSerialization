    BuildInspection()

Observability record for [`build_evaluator`](@ref): pass one via the `inspect`
keyword (`build_evaluator(doc; inspect=BuildInspection())`; [`esm_problem`](@ref)
forwards its own `inspect` keyword) and the build fills it with named
BUILD-TIME products that are otherwise internal to the evaluator closure:

* `setup_arrays::Dict{String,Array{Float64}}` — the materialized setup-time
  geometry arrays (RFC §8.1 / esm-spec §8.6.1), keyed by (flattened) observed
  name: the per-pair overlap-area matrix `A_ij`, its row-sums `A_j`, the
  normalized weights, and every other build-once geometry-derived array
  observed. This is the official inspection surface for conformance runners
  that gate per-pair regridding values (CONFORMANCE_SPEC §5.8) — the arrays
  are deliberately absent from the ODE partition, so no state/observed
  read can reach them.
* `const_arrays::Dict{String,Any}` — the full const-array registry as
  registered for the build: caller-supplied arrays, `const`-op array
  observeds, keyed-factor aliases, materialized clip rings and setup arrays.
* `observed_exprs::Dict{String,ASTExpr}` — the resolved observed substitution
  map (post index-set-range resolution and observed-into-observed inlining),
  exactly as inlined into the compiled RHS.
* `params::Dict{String,Float64}` — the resolved SCALAR parameter values (the
  model defaults with any `parameter_overrides` applied), keyed by the
  (flattened) parameter name exactly as it appears in a compiled expression
  (`"Flattened.k"`). These are load-time CONSTANTS, so binding them into a
  build-time cellwise evaluation (`evaluate_cellwise`, §6.6.5 observed/
  reference assertions, `ic` seeding) is sound and determinism-safe — unlike
  STATE, which stays out of scope. Array-backed parameters live on
  `const_arrays`, not here (the scalar map stays homogeneous `Float64`).
* `param_classes::Dict{String,Symbol}` — the PARTITION of the declared
  parameters into `:numeric` (a scalar that lands in the runtime `p`),
  `:structural` (read at BUILD time, so its value can decide the shape of the
  problem), `:const_folded` (const data frozen into the build, never in `p`)
  and `:forcing` (a live buffer a discrete provider rewrites, never in `p`).
  Derived from what the build actually read, not from what the document
  declares — see [`parameter_classes`](@ref). This is the build-level face of the same
  partition `parameter_classes(prob)` exposes on an `EsmProblem`.

Filling the record never changes the build: the returned
`(f!, u0, p, tspan, var_map)` is identical with or without `inspect`.

    DiscreteMaterializer()

The **discrete-cadence materialization** sink — the middle phase of the
three-phase cadence partition (`const ⊏ discrete ⊏ continuous`, `cadence.jl`).
Pass one via the `materialize_out` keyword of [`build_evaluator`](@ref) to
OPT IN to the cut; without it, discrete-cadence derived fields stay inlined into
the per-step RHS (the pre-cut behavior; every existing build is byte-identical).

A derived ARRAY observed whose value depends (transitively) on a live
`param_arrays` forcing buffer but NOT on any continuous `state` (nor the
independent variable `t`) changes only at the discrete refresh cadence. Inlining
it into the hot RHS recomputes the whole met→physics stack every step — and, for
a deep chain (a regrid feeding the Rothermel fire-physics), collapses into an
enormous per-cell expression the compiler cannot lower in bounded time. The cut
materializes each such field ONCE PER REFRESH into a dense cache buffer that the
hot RHS gathers via the existing zero-alloc `_NK_PARAM_GATHER` path — exactly as
it gathers a raw forcing buffer. The build fills it:

* `caches::Dict{String,Array{Float64}}` — var name → its cache buffer (the SAME
  object aliased into `pgather`, captured by reference; a `materialize!` write
  shows through to the RHS with zero reallocation).
* `materialize!::Function` — a `() -> nothing` closure that recomputes every
  cache from the (already-refreshed) raw forcing buffers + const arrays + upstream
  caches, in dependency order. `build_evaluator` runs it ONCE at build (so u0
  seeding and the first RHS evaluation read valid caches); the caller re-runs it
  after each in-place forcing refresh. [`esm_problem`](@ref) wires it as the
  refresh callback's `post_refresh` hook automatically.
* `var_order::Vector{String}` — the dependency order the fills run in.

# 2b. Build-pipeline stages
# ============================================================
# Each helper below is one stage of `_build_evaluator_impl`, extracted with
# explicit inputs/outputs so the impl body reads as a pipeline. Function names
# follow the stage banners in the impl; bodies are the original blocks.

# ---- Stage: observed synthesis + equation pre-lowering ----
# Three model-level rewrites, in order:
#  1. SYNTHESIS (universal): observed variables may be defined by their
#     `expression` field rather than an explicit equation; synthesize an
#     observed equation `name = expression` for each so-defined observed
#     (skipping any an equation already defines) so they flow through the same
#     ISR-resolution / observed-substitution pipeline as equation-defined
#     observeds. This is the transitive-inlining path that lets a DEEP
#     algebraic chain — e.g. the flattened Rothermel fire-physics chain
#     reconstituted by `flattened_to_esm` — resolve through `build_evaluator`
#     with NO caller pre-inlining (`_resolve_observed` collapses the chain to a
#     fixed point). It used to be gated on geometry, which left a non-geometry
#     expression-defined observed unbound. Synthesis only ADDS equations for
#     observeds lacking one, so equation-defined models stay byte-identical.
#  2. ELEMENTWISE ARRAY-OBSERVED FOLD (WS4): fold every array-shaped observed
#     whose lowered defining RHS is elementwise (a level-set's `U_n`, `S_n`, …)
#     into its readers, so a discretization-agnostic PDE leaf can be authored
#     with readable intermediate array fields rather than one inlined `D(ψ,t)`
#     RHS. Producer-defined array observeds (`psi_x`, `grad_mag`) survive for
#     `_array_inline_vars`. Must run BEFORE the whole-array lift so the state
#     equation carries the folded RHS.
#  3. WHOLE-ARRAY DECLARED-SHAPE DERIVATIVE LIFT: a whole-array
#     `D(state) = <array rhs>` over a declared shape is lifted into the
#     per-cell `arrayop` form the derivative partition consumes (see
#     `_lift_wholearray_deriv_equations`). Spatial-operator zeroing over a
#     structurally-0-D field is done EARLIER, at the flatten→document boundary
#     (`flattened_to_esm`), so a raw `grad`/`div`/`laplacian` reaching the
#     compiler directly (a hand-built Model, never discretized) still
#     hard-errors as the pipeline-violation guard requires. No-op for a model
#     without a whole-array D.
# Returns `(equations, folded_array_obs)`.

    # esm 1.0.0: an observed unknown's defining right-hand side IS an equation

# ---- Stage: geometry variable discovery ----
# Classify the geometry-related observeds of the model:
#  * `ring_vars` — (array-shaped) observeds whose defining expression is a
#    direct intersect_polygon clip; materialized into const_arrays at setup
#    (RFC §8.1) rather than treated as scalar observeds.
#  * `setup_vars` / `defs` — geometry-derived ARRAY observeds (ranged clips,
#    per-pair areas, A_ij), materialized at setup and excluded from the ODE
#    partition / observed substitution — build-once functions of the const
#    polygon inputs.
#  * `inline_vars` — live-field geometry observeds (ess-14f.4): array observeds
#    that are NOT build-once setup vars because they read a live `param_arrays`
#    buffer (the conservative-regrid output F_tgt = A_ij ⊗ F_src / A_j is the
#    motivating case). They are INLINED into the array-state RHS that consumes
#    them, so the build-time `index(arrayop,…)` reducer collapses
#    `index(F_tgt, j)` to F_tgt's body — yielding the proven array-state
#    aggregate kernel (const A_ij/A_j + live F_src), the met→fire coupling
#    edge. Empty (byte-identical) for files whose geometry outputs are all
#    const-fed (they stay setup vars).
# The FUSED `polygon_intersection_area` leaf (§8.6.1) triggers the SAME
# setup-geometry machinery as `intersect_polygon`: an array observed whose
# aggregate body is the fused leaf (`A_ij[i,j] = polygon_intersection_area(
# src[i], tgt[j])`) is a build-once setup const over the in-file polygon rings.
# `has_setup_geometry` gates the setup-vars discovery / materialization so the
# ranged narrow phase compiles even when NO `intersect_polygon` node survives.

# ---- Stage: FACTORED array observeds (the array analogue of the scalar slot) ----
#
# STOP INLINING ARRAY OBSERVEDS INTO EVERY READER. `_collect_array_inline_vars`
# above hands the whole class to the `index(obs, i…)` beta-reduction, which
# splices the observed's WHOLE defining body into each gather site. A
# discretization stencil gathers its operand at many points (a PPM rule reads it
# at 7 offsets, across ~7 `makearray` regions), so ONE array observed is
# duplicated ~50× per reader, and a chain of array observeds nests
# MULTIPLICATIVELY — the build allocates until it is killed before the solve
# starts.
#
# A materialized array observed is instead evaluated ONCE PER RHS CALL into a
# dense buffer, in dependency order, and every reader GATHERS that buffer. The
# buffer lives in the same flat vector as the state (slots `n_states+1…`), so a
# reader's `index(obs, i…)` resolves through the SAME `array_var_info`/`var_map`
# path a state array's gather does: no new node kind, no new access descriptor,
# full affine/stencil coverage, and — because the read compiles to `_NK_STATE` —
# the cadence classifier (const_tier.jl) calls it DYNAMIC for free, which is what
# it must be for a state-dependent field. It is also eltype-generic, so an
# AD-driven `f!` (`Dual` state or `Dual` parameters) differentiates THROUGH the
# buffer instead of truncating it to Float64 (the reason the discrete-cadence
# `pgather` cache — a state-FREE field — could not be reused here).
#
# WHAT STAYS INLINED (every one of these keeps its own path, untouched):
#   * geometry `inline_vars` / clip rings / setup vars / `polygon_intersection_area`
#     operand arrays / `const`-op + bare-alias array observeds — none of them is
#     in `array_inline_vars` to begin with;
#   * the discrete-cadence and const-cadence cadence cuts (they are removed from
#     `array_inline_vars` BEFORE this selection runs, so a per-refresh cache is
#     never also a per-call buffer), plus anything a discrete-cadence fill reads
#     (its fill kernel runs outside the RHS, where the buffer is not filled);
#   * an observed whose declared shape does not resolve to concrete extents, or
#     whose defining aggregate's own output ranges are not the dense `1…n` the
#     buffer layout addresses;
#   * every array observed at all with `ESS_ARRAY_OBS_INLINE=1`, which restores
#     the pre-change build exactly. (The `:oop` emitter used to be excluded here
#     too; it now materializes on the same terms as `:inplace` — see the
#     `mat_array_vars` note in `_build_lower_and_classify`.)
#
# GHOST CELLS. A materialized observed is a first-class array field of its
# declared shape, so a gather OUTSIDE that shape reads the ghost literal 0.0 —
# identical to the rule for an array STATE, and to a `makearray`-defined
# observed's own "no region covers ⇒ 0" default. (An aggregate-defined observed
# that a reader gathers out of range used to beta-reduce its body at the

# such a value into a dense `Array{Float64,N}`; these two stages route it to the
# channel the build already reads it from.

# `parameter_overrides` entry wins over everything, then a caller-supplied
# `const_arrays` entry (loaded data beats a document default), then the declared

# (`pert_amp`), but every document front-door reaches the build through
# `flatten`, which renames each parameter after its owning component
# (`SimpleClimate.pert_amp`). An exact-key lookup therefore MISSES the very
# spelling the spec tells authors to write, and — because the resolved scope
# feeds the coordinate-expression `ic` seed, the parameter NamedTuple, and
# `inspect.params` (the §6.6.5 reference / observed assertion scope) — the
# override was silently dropped: the run used the DEFAULT and the inline test
# still reported a verdict. A quiet wrong answer in the test runner, not a
# loud failure.
#
# So rewrite each caller key onto the name the build actually resolves, once,
# before any consumer sees it:
#   1. an exact parameter-name hit wins;
#   2. else a DOTTED key whose trailing segment is itself a parameter name
#      resolves to that parameter (`M.A` against a bare-named `Model`);
#   3. else a BARE key that is the trailing segment of exactly ONE parameter
#      resolves to it (`A` against the flattened `M.A`);
#   4. a BARE key that is the trailing segment of MORE THAN ONE parameter is
#      AMBIGUOUS — the caller named one local parameter that two mounted
#      components both carry — and is rejected naming the candidates, never
#      guessed at;
#   5. anything else matches no parameter and is rejected as UNKNOWN.
# This is the Julia counterpart of Python's `_resolve_override` and Rust's
# `Compiled::normalize_override_keys`, so one authored test behaves identically
# in all three executing bindings — see esm-spec §6.6.2 "Unrecognized override
# keys" and CONFORMANCE_SPEC §5.15.
#
# Rules 4 and 5 used to leave the key verbatim, so an unmatched override was
# INERT: the run silently used the declared default and still reported a
# verdict. That is the same silent-wrong-answer shape this canonicalization was
# introduced to fix, one level up — the author writes an override, nothing
# happens, and the model quietly measures the configuration they thought they

# ---- Build-time parameter READS: the structural/numeric discriminator -------
#
# A parameter is STRUCTURAL iff its value is consumed at BUILD time — where it
# can decide the SHAPE of the problem (a value-invention index-set extent, i.e.
# `length(u)`; a setup-geometry array's dimensions; a binning quantization; the
# u0 an `ic()` fold produces). The declared `"type": "parameter"` says nothing
# about this: every parameter is declared the same way. WHERE THE VALUE IS
# CONSUMED is the discriminator, so this records consumption rather than
# analysing the document a second time — if a name is read at build, it is
# structural, by construction.
#
# The recording is a dynamically scoped sink installed around each build-time
# consumer (`_fold_ic_equations`, `_fold_field_ics!`, `_materialize_geometry_setup`,
# `_derive_binning_coords`, `materialize_value_invention`) and read by the three
# places a NAME is actually resolved to a build-time VALUE:
#
#   * `_compile(::VarExpr, …)` (compile.jl) — the general build-time cell
#     pipeline. Both name arms record: `evaluate_expr` binds the parameter scope
#     as pseudo-STATE (`var_map`), while `_eval_cellwise` /
#     `_try_field_ic_fastpath` bind it as `param_syms`.
#   * `_geo_compile(::VarExpr, …)` (geometry_compile.jl) — the setup-time
#     geometry compiler, which folds a scalar `env` entry to a literal.
#   * `_vi_param` (value_invention.jl) — the relational engine's own evaluator.
#
# Recording at the RESOLUTION site (not at the dict) is what makes it precise:
# every one of those consumers materializes the WHOLE parameter scope into a
# NamedTuple/vector before compiling, so a read-recording Dict would report
# every parameter as structural. Only the compiler knows which names the
# expression actually mentions.
#
# The sink is `nothing` outside those scopes — in particular during the ODE RHS
# compile, where a parameter read is a RUNTIME read of `p` and therefore
# NUMERIC, the exact opposite conclusion.

#                     and overridable at solve time by swapping `p`.
#   `:structural`   — read at BUILD time (see `_PARAM_READS`). Its value can
#                     change the shape of the problem, so changing it is a
#                     rebuild, not a `p` swap. Per NAME, not per use: a name
#                     read once at build is structural even if the RHS also
#                     reads it at runtime.
#   `:const_folded` — supplied as CONST DATA (a const provider / caller
#                     `const_arrays` entry), frozen into the
#                     build and inlined into the RHS. It never reaches `p`, so a

# STOP INLINING SCALAR OBSERVEDS. The author-declared name of a scalar observed
# IS a sharing declaration — splicing its body into every reader erases the name
# and then several passes (scalar CSE plus the access-kernel invariant/per-cell CSE
# tiers) re-discover the
# sharing structurally. Instead each safe scalar observed compiles ONCE as a
# NAMED PRELUDE DEF (an ordinary `_NK_CACHED` slot in the scalar CSE prelude,
# evaluated in dependency order before the equations — see `_cse_compile_scalar`);
# every scalar-equation reader references the slot.
#
# WHAT STAYS INLINED (falls back to today's `_sub_preserving` splice, i.e. the
# entry is left in the `inline` map):
#   * ARRAY-valued observeds (arrayop/makearray producers, geometry live fields,
#     promoted array observeds) — the `index(obs, i)` beta-reduction path is
#     untouched by design;
#   * LEAF bodies (a bare variable/literal alias) — a slot would cost a store +
#     a read to replace a bare leaf read;
#   * STRUCTURAL references — an observed read where the build needs a concrete
#     value at build time (a gather subscript, a range bound; see
#     `_obs_structural_refs!`);
#   * GUARD-ONLY references — the prelude is unconditional while the scalar
#     walkers are lazy for `ifelse`/`and`/`or`, so an observed referenced ONLY
#     under guards must not be hoisted into unconditional evaluation (same rule
#     the CSE pass applies per-key; see `_count_obs_refs!`). The demotion is a
#     fixed point: a slot kept alive only by a demoted def's references is
#     demoted in turn, so every surviving slot has an unconditional evaluation
#     site in the pre-slot walk — hoisting it introduces no new throw/NaN.
#
# The ARRAY paths (arrayop kernels, stencil/affine builds, discrete-cadence
# fills) keep receiving the FULL resolved map and inline exactly as before; a
# kernel's inlined copy of a slotted observed is later collapsed onto the
# observed's slot by `_share_kernel_invariants!` when the value numbers match.
#

#
# FEASIBILITY GATE (declarative-or-fail). A refreshable forcing read CANNOT be
# expressed over the existing runtime vocabulary the closure `f!(du,u,p,t)`
# already reads, as each candidate was checked and rejected:
#   • const_arrays   — `index(arr,…)` const-folds to a `NumExpr` literal at
#     build time (the const-array branch of `_resolve_indices`); post-build
#     mutation has zero effect. A refreshable buffer cannot ride it.
#   • scalar `p` cells (one named Float64 per cell) — keeps `p` homogeneous but
#     a NamedTuple of thousands of fields compiles pathologically AND scattered
#     named scalars cannot gather as a contiguous slice, breaking the
#     N-independent vectorized kernel. Refresh needs an `integrator.p` rebind.
#   • state `u` — live + callback-mutable, but the integrator INTEGRATES it
#     (pollutes the user's `u0`/solution + the adaptive error norm) and a
#     callback write needs `u_modified!(true)` ⇒ trajectory re-init each
#     boundary. Forcing is exogenous, not a state.
#   • an array field in the SAME `p`, read via `getfield(p, n.sym)` (the plan's
#     literal mechanism) — allocates: a runtime-symbol `getfield` on a
#     heterogeneous NamedTuple boxes the union, and regresses the EXISTING scalar
#     `_NK_PARAM` path too. "Monomorphic getfield" holds only
#     for a compile-time-literal symbol, never the tree-walk's runtime `n.sym`.
# CONCLUSION: node JUSTIFIED. Realize the read as a build-time-CAPTURED,
# by-reference flat `Vector{Float64}` aliasing the caller's dense buffer
# (`vec` shares storage; the J1 refresh callback's in-place `.=` shows
# through). `_NK_PARAM_GATHER` is the zero-alloc
# dual of the const-fold: the SAME `index` IR, rerouted by binding-time cadence
# class. No new IR op / schema field / declarative vocabulary; disjoint from
# the scalar `p`, so existing scalar reads stay byte-identical.

# when `<def>` is an `aggregate` whose own `output_idx` matches. `index(<def>, i…)`
# is EXACTLY the expression every reader of this observed used to present after
# inlining, so the fill lowers through the identical, already-exercised path.
#
# HISTORICALLY this was also a correctness requirement, because the bare form
# routed a contraction into the affine LANE derivation, whose const-lane fold
# (`_derive_lane_repl`, stencil_affine.jl) then decided a lane was loop-invariant
# by comparing its VALUES at the box CORNERS: a const gather agreeing at the
# corners and differing inside — a regrid weight column `W[i, j]` reading
# (0, 0.5, 0) — folded to a literal 0.0 and the interior cell silently computed
# the wrong number. That hole is CLOSED: `_derive_lane_repl` no longer samples
# values, deriving invariance structurally from the resolved linear index
# instead. The gather form is now a lowering-path default, not a guard.
#
# EXCEPTION, applied downstream rather than here: a producer that CONTRACTS is
# unwrapped back to the bare form by `_unwrap_identity_gather`. The gather form
# hides a contraction from `_compile_arrayop_equation!` entirely (it tests
# `rhs.op == "aggregate"` and sees `index`), so scan detection, the unrolled fold
# and the runtime contraction loop are all skipped and the equation drops to the
# per-cell tier at O(#cells) IR. A NON-contracting producer keeps the gather

    # vector the fills write into — a fold reads back only the slots its own term
    # kernels wrote, and no observed in a level can read another observed of the

    # whose own body is a prefix reduction therefore keeps the triangular path —

# Which axis do the TERMS live on? Two shapes are admitted, and they are the

# `out[i] = out[i-1] ⊕ term[i]` for the inclusive one — differing only in how
# many output cells that recurrence has to fill:
#
#   SAME-RANGE (`nothing`). Output and terms share the axis, which is the only
#   shape a scan could take before this. The term build runs over the output
#   range verbatim.
#
#   STAGGERED (a modified range vector). The output is the axis's NODES and the
#   terms its CENTRES — one fewer — which is how a cumulative flux is spelled on
#   a staggered grid: `Mz[ke] = -Σ_{k < ke}(…)` over `lev_nodes` contracting
#   `lev` (ReSEACT's diagnosed vertical air-mass flux). Admitted ONLY for the
#   STRICT window, and only when the contracted range is exactly the output
#   range minus its LAST cell, because that is precisely the condition under
#   which `{k ∈ terms : k < i}` equals `{k ∈ terms : k < i-1} ∪ {i-1}` for every
#   output cell — i.e. the same prefix recurrence, run one step further. The
#   INCLUSIVE window is declined: `out[i] = ⊕_{k <= i}` over a longer output
#   axis would need a term at the last node, which does not exist.
#
#   The last output node is then left UNCOVERED by the term build and untouched
#   by the term kernels. That is safe by inspection of `_scan_lanes!` /
#   `_scan_lanes_oop` (scan.jl): the strict fold WRITES `du[s] = acc` at every
#   cell and only reads the slot into a `term` it accumulates into an `acc` that
#   the loop then discards — so whatever the slot held on entry (0̄ from `du`
#   zeroing, or a stale observed-buffer value) cannot reach an output. The fold
#   itself is untouched by this change, which is what keeps scan.jl's
#   bit-exactness argument intact.
#
# See through a materialized observed's IDENTITY GATHER to the CONTRACTING
# producer underneath.
#
# `_materialized_fill_equation` synthesizes every array-observed fill as
# `index(<def>, i…)` rather than handing over the bare producer, so the fill
# lowers through the identical, already-exercised path every reader used after
# inlining. That is the right default and it stays. But `_compile_arrayop_equation!`
# detects a contraction by testing `rhs.op == "aggregate"` — it sees `index`,
# leaves `contract_names` empty, and NONE of the contraction machinery runs:
# not `_detect_prefix_scan`, not `_unrolled_contraction_body`, not the runtime
# contraction loop. The affine build is then handed `index(<contracting
# aggregate>, i…)` directly, which `_stencilize_indexed` cannot model
# ("index(aggregate) with contracted index"), so the whole equation lands on the
# per-cell tier at O(#cells) IR. On a real transport model a staggered prefix scan
# and its column integrals all declined here rather than at any tier's own guard.
#
# WHY IT IS SAFE FOR MORE THAN A SCAN. This unwrap was originally admitted for
# prefix scans ALONE, because `_derive_lane_repl` (stencil_affine.jl) used to
# decide a const lane was loop-invariant by comparing its VALUES at the box
# CORNERS: a const gather that agreed at the corners and differed inside — a
# regrid weight column (0, 0.5, 0) — folded to a literal and silently zeroed the
# interior cell. A scan never reaches that fold. `_derive_lane_repl` no longer
# samples values at all; it derives invariance STRUCTURALLY from the resolved
# linear INDEX (an all-zero stride vector over the box), so the fold cannot be
# fooled by adversarial data and the restriction is no longer needed.
#
# STILL DELIBERATELY NARROW: the bare form is adopted only when it UNLOCKS
# something — i.e. only when the producer actually contracts. A non-contracting
# aggregate lowers identically either way, so it keeps the gather form and the
# default above governs it unchanged. Beyond that, the contracted bounds must all
# be constant integer ranges and there must be no join gate, which are exactly
# the preconditions `_unrolled_contraction_body` states for a shared fold
# template; anything else would take the per-cell path from the bare form too,
# so there would be nothing to gain and a lowering to change.
#
# Returns the bare producer when every guard holds, else `rhs` unchanged.

    # ── Array-einsum runtime contraction loop (ess-runtime-contraction) ────────
    # An array-producing aggregate `out[i…] = ⊕_{k…} body(i…, k…)` with a UNIFORM
    # constant-bound inner reduction is compiled to ONE `_NK_CONTRACTION_LOOP` per
    # OUTPUT cell (the contracted indices k… kept SYMBOLIC, the output indices i…
    # concrete) instead of unrolling the body into `∏|k…|` terms per cell — so build
    # IR is O(1) in the reduction length per cell (vs O(∏|k…|), quadratic-or-worse).
    # The loop cells route to `percell_scalar` (→ `rhs_list`, the `ESS_STENCIL_DISABLE`
    # scalar-walk REFERENCE path), so the loop node NEVER reaches the affine /
    # acc-merge / access-kernel / oop-merge / codegen passes, which model unrolled
    # scalar terms — the same safety envelope the scalar-reduction loop uses. Gated
    # exactly as the scalar path (const integer bounds, ⊕∈{+,*,max,min}, no join /
    # filter, total length ≥ floor) PLUS a loopability PROBE on the first output cell:
    # if the body indexes STATE at a contracted index (no static per-k slot) the probe
    # returns `nothing` and the einsum takes the existing affine / unroll path,
    # unchanged. Small reductions (< floor) also keep the existing path, so the vast
    # existing array-kernel test surface is byte-for-byte unaffected.
    #
    # PREEMPTION — which tier is cheaper is NOT a property of the equation alone.
    # The two build costs are:
    #
    #   contraction loop   one resolve + `_compile` per OUTPUT CELL, each O(1) in
    #                      the reduction length            →  O(#output cells)
    #   unroll + affine    one resolve + `_compile` per STRUCTURAL GROUP over a
    #                      body of ∏|k…| terms             →  O(#groups · ∏|k…|)
    #
    # Only the FIRST of those grows with the grid: `#groups` is a fact of the
    # DOCUMENT (boundary classes, makearray regions), and `∏|k…|` a fact of the
    # reduction, so the affine tier is the grid-independent one and the loop is
    # not. Deciding the loop unconditionally — testing it BEFORE the affine block
    # and gating that block on `!use_contraction_loop` — therefore hands the
    # O(#cells) tier every reduction at or above the floor, INCLUDING the ones the
    # affine tier would have compiled once for the whole array. On a transport
    # model that is every plain column sum (`Σ_k dp[i,j,k]·f[i,j,k]·c[i,j,k]`, one
    # output cell per COLUMN): 14 of them in ReSEACT, each re-resolved and
    # re-compiled 18 721 times at 0.25°, for a build that is linear in the grid
    # and O(1)-per-column IR that the affine tier would have built once.
    #
    # So the loop PREEMPTS the affine tier only when it is the cheaper of the two.
    # `#groups ≥ 1` always, so `#output cells < ∏|k…|` is the most optimistic
    # (single-group) form of "the unroll cannot be cheaper" — the loop keeps the
    # equation whenever it holds, which is exactly the small-output / long-reduction
    # shape the loop was added for (`contraction_loop_test.jl`'s 2×2 outputs over
    # M² ∈ {16 … 1681} terms all still take it, byte for byte). When it does NOT
    # hold the affine tier is OFFERED the equation first and the loop stays behind
    # it as the fallback: a declined affine build lands on exactly the same
    # `_NK_CONTRACTION_LOOP` per-cell path as before, so no equation loses the loop,
    # and one that the affine tier accepts was never a candidate for a per-cell

                    parameter_overrides=Dict(), tspan=nothing,
                    registered_functions=Dict(), kwargs...)

Build a tree-walk ODE RHS evaluator for `model`. Public entry point —
returns `(f!, u0, p, tspan, var_map)`. Thin wrapper over
`_build_evaluator_impl`, which additionally returns build diagnostics
consumed by the ess-dhq N-independence property test.

All state variables must be scalar (shape === nothing) — the walker
assumes equations have already been scalarized by the discretize
pipeline. `arrayop` and `makearray` are supported in expression
position: scalar `arrayop` (empty `output_idx`) is expanded inline;
`index(arrayop(...), k...)` and `index(makearray(...), k...)` are
resolved at build time. Other array-typed ops (`broadcast`, `reshape`,
`transpose`, `concat`) raise `E_TREEWALK_UNSUPPORTED_OP`.

The returned `f!` closure reads `u`, the captured parameter vector
`p` (a NamedTuple keyed by parameter name), and `t`, and writes
time-derivatives into `du`. Observed variables are substituted into
RHS expressions at build time.

Keyword arguments (see `_build_evaluator_impl` for the full set,
including `const_arrays`, `param_arrays`, `const_array_boundaries`,
`index_sets`, and `inspect`):

* `initial_conditions::AbstractDict` — override the default values in
  `model.variables` for specific state variables. A value is a real number,
  or — for a SHAPED unknown — INLINE ARRAY DATA (a nested array matching the
  declared `shape`, esm-spec §6.6.2), which is expanded into the per-cell
  initial values.
* `parameter_overrides::AbstractDict` — override the default
  values for specific parameters. A value is a real number, or — for a SHAPED
  parameter — INLINE ARRAY DATA, which is registered as build-time data in
  `const_arrays` rather than as a scalar `p` slot (esm-spec §6.3 / §6.6.2). Keys may be spelled either LOCALLY
  (`pert_amp`, the form esm-spec §6.6 pins for a test's
  `parameter_overrides`) or with the flattening qualification the run
  document carries (`SimpleClimate.pert_amp`); both resolve to the same
  parameter, and an ambiguous local name (the same parameter in two
  mounted components) is left unbound rather than guessed at. The
  resolved values are load-time constants, so they bind the build-time
  evaluation scope too — the coordinate-expression `ic` seed and the
  §6.6.5 reference / observed assertion scope reported via `inspect` —
  not just the runtime parameter NamedTuple.
* `tspan::Union{Nothing,Tuple{Real,Real}}` — explicit time span. If
  `nothing`, the first inline `tests` block's `time_span` is used; if
  the model has no tests, the null default `(0.0, 1.0)` is returned.
* `registered_functions::Dict{String,<:Function}` — handlers for
  `call` ops, keyed by `handler_id`.
* `form::Symbol` — which RHS to emit (`:inplace`, the default, or `:oop`).
  `:inplace` gives the `f!(du, u, p, t)` above: zero-allocation at Float64
  AND eltype-generic, so it both solves and differentiates (ForwardDiff
  over the state or over the parameters; a stiff solve gets an exact AD
  Jacobian for free). It is the right answer for almost everything.
  `:oop` gives an out-of-place `f(u, p, t) → du`. Reach for it only to
  TRACE — it is what XLA/Reactant and device backends can consume, because
  it captures no host scratch buffers and contains no per-lane scalar
  loops. It is not faster and not more differentiable than `f!`; it
  allocates one temporary per AST node. Both come from the same compiled
  IR in the same evaluation order, so a Float64 `:oop` call is
  bit-identical to `f!` — which is why the in-place tests use it as their
  oracle. SciML dispatches `ODEProblem` on RHS arity, so either drops into
  `ODEProblem(f, u0, tspan, p)` unchanged. The `:oop` RHS additionally
  carries an explicit-buffers form for tracing backends — its live forcing
  buffers (`param_arrays` + discrete caches) exposed as ARGUMENTS via
  [`rhs_with_buffers`](@ref) / [`forcing_buffers`](@ref) /
  [`forcing_buffer_index`](@ref), so `@compile` receives them as real XLA
  inputs and an in-place refresh stays visible to the compiled program.

"""
    param_map(p) -> Dict{String,Int}

Parameter NAME → its position in a parameter VECTOR, the `p`-side mirror of the
`var_map` [`build_evaluator`](@ref) returns for the state.

Take it from the `p` that `build_evaluator` handed back:

```julia
f!, u0, p, tspan, var_map = build_evaluator(doc)
pm = param_map(p)                  # "k_diff" => 1, "k_rxn" => 3, …
θ  = ComponentVector(p)            # the same order, as an AbstractVector
f!(du, u, θ, t)                    # …and it is accepted as `p`
```

`build_evaluator` keeps returning its 5-tuple — 391 call sites destructure it —
so this is a FUNCTION OF `p` rather than a sixth return value. That costs nothing
in fidelity: the order is the build's own (`param_names` is sorted, and the `p`
NamedTuple is built from it in that order), and `keys(p)` IS that order, so this
map and the `idx` baked into every `_NK_PARAM` node are the same numbering by
construction rather than by agreement.

A parameter-free model carries SciMLBase's `nothing` sentinel as `p` and maps to
the empty Dict.
"""
param_map(p::NamedTuple) = Dict{String,Int}(String(k) => i

"""
    parameter_classes(x) -> Dict{String,Symbol}

Parameter NAME → what KIND of parameter it is in the build that produced `x`
(a [`BuildInspection`](@ref) or an `EsmProblem`). Four classes:

| class | where its value is consumed | overridable at solve time? |
|---|---|---|
| `:numeric` | the runtime `p` vector | **yes** — swap `p` (`remake`), differentiable |
| `:structural` | BUILD time (setup geometry, value-invention extents, binning coordinates, `ic()` folds) | no — rebuild the problem |
| `:const_folded` | frozen into the build's const arrays and inlined into the RHS | no — rebuild with new data |
| `:forcing` | a live buffer a discrete provider rewrites in place | no — write the buffer |

The partition is **derived, not declared**: every one of these is spelled
`"type": "parameter"` in the document, so the discriminator is where the value is
CONSUMED. The build records the names its build-time consumers resolve (see the
`_PARAM_READS` seam) and anything they touched is `:structural` — by
construction, not by a second static reading of the document.

`:structural` is per NAME, not per use: a name read once at build stays
structural even when the RHS also reads it at runtime, because the value baked
into the build and the value in `p` would then disagree.

`:const_folded` deserves its own name rather than being folded into
`:structural`: differentiating w.r.t. one returns an unconditional ZERO, and a
finite-difference check on its declared default CONFIRMS that zero (perturbing
the default changes nothing either) — a wrong gradient and a wrong check
agreeing silently. It is refused explicitly, with its own message.

Like [`param_map`](@ref) this is a function of an artifact rather than an extra
`build_evaluator` return value: the 5-tuple has hundreds of destructuring call
sites. Pass `inspect = BuildInspection()` to `build_evaluator` / `esm_problem`,
or read it off the `EsmProblem` that `esm_problem` returns.

```julia
prob = esm_problem("model.esm", tspan)
