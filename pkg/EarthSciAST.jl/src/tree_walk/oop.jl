# `_AccKernel`s) that `_make_rhs` lowers to `f!(du, u, p, t)`.
# ========================================================================

# ============================================================
# 4d. Out-of-place RHS: `f(u, p, t) -> du`
# ============================================================
#
# WHY A SECOND EMITTER — and what it is NOT for.
# ----------------------------------------------
# It is NOT the AD path. `f!` (`_make_rhs`, acc_merge.jl) is eltype-generic in its own right: it
# is zero-alloc AND bit-identical at Float64, and it differentiates under ForwardDiff
# over the state or the parameters. Differentiate with `f!`. Solve with `f!`. If you
# are reaching for this file to get a derivative on the CPU, you are in the wrong file.
#
# THIS EMITTER EXISTS TO BE TRACED — by XLA/Reactant today (ext/EarthSciASTReactantExt.jl),
# by any device backend tomorrow. What makes it traceable is not the out-of-place
# SIGNATURE, which is incidental, but two properties `f!` cannot have without ceasing
# to be `f!`:
#
#   1. NO CAPTURED HOST BUFFERS. `f!` writes into preallocated `Vector{Float64}` scratch
#      created at build time — the CSE prelude's `_cse_buf` and each `_AccKernel`'s
#      `_AccCSE` tiers. A traced value cannot be written
#      into concrete host memory. Nor does `f!`'s eltype-generic alt-buffer rescue it:
#      under tracing the value type is `TracedRNumber{Float64}`, so the lazy buffer
#      would be a HOST `Vector{TracedRNumber}` — a Julia array of traced scalars, which
#      is not a traced array. (And XLA assigns its own buffers anyway, so ours would be
#      redundant even if they worked.)
#   2. NO PER-LANE SCALAR LOOPS. `f!` still walks lanes one at a time in several arms —
#      the gather (`b[j] = u[s[j]]`), the pgather, the `du` scatter, the interp kernels.
#      XLA REJECTS scalar indexing of a traced array outright. Every one of those is a
#      whole-array op here (`u[slots]`, `du[out] = res`). That de-scalarization is the
#      real content of this file.
#
# Fix both in `f!` and you would have rewritten this walker. They converge; that is why
# there are two, and why neither subsumes the other.
#
# Its second, quieter job: it is an INDEPENDENT implementation of the same IR, so it is
# the oracle the in-place tests use to prove `f!` still computes the same Float64 answers
# (tree_walk_iip_generic_test.jl). Two emitters that must agree bit-for-bit keep each
# other honest.
#
# `build_evaluator(model; form = :oop)` returns `f(u, p, t) -> du` in the `f!` slot of
# the usual `(f, u0, p, tspan, var_map)` tuple; SciML dispatches `ODEProblem` on RHS
# arity, so it drops straight in.
#
# The value type is derived from `u`, `p` AND `t` together — see `_oop_value_type` —
# never from `eltype(u)` alone, which would throw `Float64(::Dual)` the moment anyone
# differentiated with respect to a PARAMETER (there `u` stays `Float64` and only the
# parameter values go `Dual`).
#
# ENZYME NEEDS ONE FLAG, and it is worth knowing why before trying to remove it:
#
#     Enzyme.API.strictAliasing!(false)     # once, before any autodiff call
#
# Without it, Enzyme's type analysis rejects the RHS — not because of anything this
# file does, but because the walk LOADS the `payload::Any` variant slot out of `_Node`
# (compile.jl), one field serving twelve node kinds. The failure is an
# `IllegalTypeAnalysisException` naming `_oop_eval` and the `getproperty` that loads
# it. ForwardDiff, which analyzes types the way Julia does, is unaffected.
#
# Three things about that are easy to get wrong (scripts, logs and the full argument
# in scripts/enzyme_aliasing/):
#
#   * It is not an `:oop` problem. The in-place `f!` fails identically, at
#     `_eval_node`. The wart belongs to the shared `_Node` IR.
#   * The tree need not CONTAIN the offending kind. A 0-D model with no loop-var,
#     gather or `fn` node still fails on the `_NK_LOOPVAR` arm: Enzyme analyzes the
#     whole statically reachable method, so an arm this model can never execute
#     poisons the walk anyway. Runtime cleverness is therefore not a strategy.
#   * It is the LOAD, not the field. A struct that still declares `payload::Any` but
#     whose walk never loads it differentiates fine, so routing around the payload
#     helps arm by arm — the failure just moves to the next load. Barriers clear them
#     one at a time until the wall they cannot: `_oop_fn`'s boxed `Vector{Any}` args
#     handed to a `String`-dispatched registry, whose contents are ACTIVE. That needs
#     a typed calling convention, not a barrier.
#
# The flag is a wart, not a hazard: per Enzyme's own C++ it only makes type analysis
# DECLINE to propagate facts upward through phis/selects. The flag that can fabricate
# a type — and so produce wrong derivatives — is `looseTypeAnalysis!`, a different
# global read by different code. Being process-global with no scoped alternative, its
# real cost is blast radius, not correctness.
#
# The durable fix is a payload-free IR: lower the compiled IR ONCE at build time into
# a concretely-typed tree with the variant resolved statically. An XLA/Reactant
# backend wants that lowering regardless, and codegen_kernel.jl already does it for
# the array kernels of `f!`. It is not on its own a route to Enzyme support, though:
# with the codegen tier on, Enzyme fails on the emitted RuntimeGeneratedFunction with
# an internal `UndefVarError`.
#
# THE ONE LADDER. `_oop_op` evaluates an op over ALREADY-EVALUATED children using
# broadcast (`.+`, `sin.`, …) throughout. Broadcasting two scalars yields a scalar,
# so the SAME ladder serves the scalar walker (children all `T`) and the
# access-kernel lane walker (children a mix of `T` and `Vector{T}`) — no third arm
# set to drift out of sync with `_eval_node_op` and `_eval_acc_op`. The op-coverage
# test asserts this ladder accepts every op those two accept.
#
# PERFORMANCE SHAPE. On the host this form is slower than the in-place `f!` and
# allocates per call. That cost is not the tree walk — which is O(#nodes), not
# O(#cells), so its dynamic dispatch amortizes over the cell axis — it is the
# DEFINING cost of being out of place: one fresh temporary per AST node instead of
# `f!`'s preallocated `buf`s, plus the GC pressure. It is what you trade the
# buffers for, not a bug to optimize away.
#
# So do NOT reach for this form to go faster, and do not reach for it to differentiate
# on the CPU either — `f!` does both better. Reach for it when the target is a tracer or
# a device, where the buffers this form lacks are exactly the thing standing in the way.

# ---- Value type -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The RHS's value type is fixed by the three runtime inputs: the state, the
# parameter values, and time — see `_rhs_value_type` (compile.jl), whose
# rationale (deriving `T` from all three, not just `eltype(u)`, is load-bearing
# under ForwardDiff-over-parameters) applies verbatim here. The two emitters
# MUST agree on the value type, so this is the same function under the
# emitter-local name (it was an identical hand-copy until the promised dedupe).
const _oop_value_type = _rhs_value_type

# ---- Container seams (GPU / Reactant) ---------------------------------------
#
# The two places the RHS touches the state by index. Kept as named one-liners so a
# device or tracing backend can add a method instead of forking the walker: XLA
# rejects scalar indexing of a traced array, and needs `u[i:i]` (a size-1 slice,
# which broadcasts against full-length lanes) in place of `u[i]`.
@inline _oop_read_state(u, i::Int) = @inbounds u[i]

# A plain indexed gather, deliberately. A stencil's slots are almost always a
# contiguous run (`c[i-1]` over the interior is the state window shifted by one), so
# it is tempting to detect that and take `u[a:b]` instead. It buys nothing on the
# HOST: this RHS is bound by allocating one temporary per node, not by the gather's
# addressing mode, and Reactant lowers a constant-stride run to a slice on its own.
# What it does NOT lower is a strided BOX (a 3-D kernel class's `out .+ delta`,
# see `_oop_acc_lanes`), whose gather is cheap forward but whose REVERSE is a
# serial scatter-add; the Reactant extension's `ESS_OOP_SHIFT_SLICE=1` emits
# such a read as a slice of the reshaped state instead (reverse: a pad).
@inline _oop_gather(u, slots::Vector{Int}) = @inbounds u[slots]

# ---- Read interning, TRACE ONLY (ess-oop-intern) -----------------------------
#
# The SAME window of the SAME container is read many times inside one RHS
# evaluation: a materialized array observed lives in the flat extended state
# tensor `ue`, and every acc-kernel descriptor that reads it emits its own read.
# On a real chemistry mechanism most emitted `stablehlo.slice` ops are exact
# `(operand, window)` duplicates. XLA then rediscovers that with
# `CSE<stablehlo::SliceOp>`, a PAIRWISE (quadratic) pattern that dominates compile
# time on large grids. Emitting the read once removes the duplicate before it exists.
#
# WHY THIS IS A THIRD ARGUMENT AND NOT A GLOBAL. The memo has to die with the
# trace that created it: an SSA value from a finished module is not usable in the
# next one. So it is carried by `_OopForcing`, which `_make_rhs_oop`'s closure
# constructs FRESH on every call and threads to every read site — the memo's
# lifetime is then exactly one RHS invocation, by construction. Nothing to tear
# down, nothing to leak on an exception, nothing shared between threads, and no
# way for one trace's values to reach another. It is also the largest scope that
# is SOUND: a trace of a `@trace for` body puts the RHS's ops in a nested REGION,
# and a value defined in one region does not dominate a use in the next, so a
# memo living longer than one invocation could emit IR that does not verify.
#
# WHY IT IS TRACE-ONLY. On host the containers are MUTATED IN PLACE — `_oop_store`
# and `_oop_scatter` write and return the same array — so a read cache keyed on
# container identity would hand back pre-write data. Under a trace the writes are
# FUNCTIONAL: `setindex!` on a `TracedRArray` rebinds the object's MLIR value, so
# "which SSA value is this container right now" is a complete description of its
# CONTENTS, and that is what the extension keys on. Host therefore builds NO memo
# (`_oop_new_memo` returns `nothing`) and `_oop_gather(u, slots, ::Nothing)` is
# the two-argument gather verbatim — the host path is byte-identical.
#
# `ESS_OOP_INTERN=0` declines the memo (the extension's `_oop_new_memo` then also
# returns `nothing`), so a traced build can be compared with the feature off.
@inline _oop_gather(u, slots::Vector{Int}, ::Nothing) = _oop_gather(u, slots)
@inline _oop_gather(u, slots::Vector{Int}, memo) = _oop_gather(u, slots)

# The memo constructor seam. `nothing` on host and under every non-tracing
# element type (`Dual`, `Float32`, …); the Reactant extension adds the one method
# that returns a real memo, for a `TracedRArray` state.
@inline _oop_new_memo(u) = nothing

# ---- Emission-time value numbering, TRACE ONLY (ess-oop-gvn) -----------------
#
# The read memo above removes duplicate READS. This removes duplicate ops, by the
# same argument and through the same per-call object.
#
# WHY THERE IS ANYTHING LEFT TO REMOVE. The compiled IR is a DAG — the build shares
# subtrees aggressively (`src/intern.jl` hash-consing, `_sub_preserving`, the CSE
# prelude, `_build_acc_cse`, xcse) — but `_oop_eval` / `_oop_eval_acck` walk it as a
# TREE. There is no per-node memo and there cannot easily be one, because the same
# node is legitimately evaluated against different states (`u` vs the extended `ue`),
# different CSE caches and different loop-counter values. So a shared subtree is
# re-EMITTED once per parent. On host that is free; under a trace each re-walk
# manufactures a fresh cone of MLIR ops that XLA must rediscover as redundant,
# pairwise.
#
# WHY THE KEY IS EMITTED VALUES, not AST nodes. An op is redundant exactly when its
# opcode and its OPERAND VALUES match an earlier one — a property of the emitted SSA
# values, not of the AST that produced them. That key is sound with no analysis (two
# pure ops over the same SSA values compute the same tensor; `u` vs `ue`, cache and
# loop iteration all show up as different operand values), and exactly
# bit-preserving (the reused value IS what the duplicate would have emitted, so
# every consumer sees an identical tensor). It is `cse` moved from the compiler to
# the emitter.
#
# SCALAR CONSTANTS ARE THE LOAD-BEARING PART. Reactant memoizes ARRAY constants by
# value, but a SCALAR constant goes `Ops.constant(::Number)` -> `Ops.fill` -> a
# fresh `stablehlo.constant` every time. One coefficient used at N sites therefore
# arrives as N distinct SSA values, which BREAKS THE CASCADE: `k .* x` at two sites
# has different operand ids, so neither the products nor their consumers share.
#
# Lifetime and region-soundness are the read memo's, because it IS the read memo's
# object: one RHS invocation, one MLIR block, ops only ever appended.
#
# Host builds `nothing` for the memo, so every seam below is its unmemoized
# definition with a zero-sized third argument, and the host path is unchanged.
# Both this and native emission are OPT-IN — see `_oop_new_memo` in
# ext/EarthSciASTReactantExt.jl for the switches and their default.

# The arithmetic ladder, value-numbered. `memo` is `nothing` on host and for any
# backend that does not specialize it, so this is `_oop_op(op, c, T)` verbatim.
#
# A backend may also use this seam to emit the op DIRECTLY rather than through Julia
# broadcast (ess-oop-native): Reactant's broadcast lowering manufactures identity
# `broadcast_in_dim`s, identity `transpose`s and never-read `constant`s around every
# elementwise op — not duplicates for CSE to find, just scaffolding for the
# canonicalizer to delete. The extension bypasses that for the operations whose
# StableHLO form IS the IEEE operation Julia's operator is (`+ - * /` and negation)

# ---- interp knot addressing: the seams a TRACER replaces --------------------
#
# The three primitive shapes the lane forms below are built from, factored out
# as SEAMS for exactly the reason `_oop_read_state` is one: the branch-free
# select-ladder lowering is RIGHT for host / ForwardDiff — a handful of fused
# broadcasts over a 2–3 knot table, no branch, no allocation per knot — and
# catastrophically WRONG for a tracer on a big table, where every ladder step is
# a separate traced op and the emitted program is O(table) PER CALL SITE.
#
# On a photolysis-style component with several bilinear calls over tables of a few
# thousand entries, the ladder traces to a program dominated by `select`/`compare`
# scaffolding rather than arithmetic, and XLA compile can exhaust host memory.
#
# A tracer has a constant-time primitive for precisely this — `stablehlo.gather`
# on a constant table — so a backend replaces the three ladders HERE rather than
# forking the three lane evaluators. What a backend method must honour,
# bit-for-bit:
#
#   `_oop_knot_count(knots, q, cmp)`   Σ_k [cmp(knots[k], q)] as a Float64 lane
#         value. The terms are 0.0/1.0 and n ≪ 2^53, so the sum is EXACT in any
#         association order, and so is any other route to the same integer: what
#         a backend owes is the ladder's VALUE, not its shape, for every query
#         including NaN (which fails every compare and contributes 0.0 here).
#         A `reduce` along the knot axis is the obvious lowering; the Reactant
#         backend instead locates elementwise (a capped ladder for a small axis,
#         an arithmetic guess corrected by two gathers for a big uniform one, the
#         reduce as a fallback) — see the `count-locate` header in
#         ext/EarthSciASTReactantExt.jl and test/reactant_locate_test.jl for the
#         exactness argument and its pins.
#   `_oop_knot_pair(v, i)`             `(v[i], v[i+1])` elementwise, `i` an
#         exactly-integral Float64 lane index in `[1, length(v)-1]`. SELECTION,
#         never a blend — the table entry comes through bit-exact (no `0·Inf`,
#         no signed-zero surprise), which a gather also gives by construction.
#   `_oop_knot_pair2(a, b, i)`         the same, for two same-length tables at
#         one index, sharing the ladder's compares (the linear evaluator's
#         axis+table pair; kept fused so the host op count is UNCHANGED).

# ---- interp.* over whole LANES: locate → gather → blend ----------------------
#

# forms an XLA/Reactant trace needs): NO branch on the query, NO opaque scalar
# core inside a broadcast — every step is elementwise arithmetic + a knot-
# addressing seam, so a traced query lane vector flows through as whole-array ops
# and the emitted program's size is independent of the GRID. (It is independent
# of the TABLE too, but only on a backend that gives the seams above a gather;
# the default lowering is the O(table) select ladder — see the seam header.)
#
# BIT-IDENTICAL to the scalar cores, by mirroring their decision trees with
# `ifelse` selects instead of branches:
#   * locate: `i = clamp(Σ_k [axis[k] ≤ x], 1, n-1)` — for a validated strictly-
#     increasing axis this is exactly the scan's "largest k with axis[k] ≤ x".
#   * gather: `_oop_knot_pair` / `_oop_bilinear_corners` SELECT (never blend)
#     the cell's endpoints, so table entries come through exactly (no `0·Inf`, no
#     signed-zero surprises).
#   * blend: the cores' pinned form `tᵢ + w·(tᵢ₊₁ − tᵢ)` verbatim.
#   * clamps: the same outer `x ≤ axis[1]` / `x ≥ axis[n]` selects the cores
#     early-return on. A NaN query fails both compares, takes the blend arm, and
#     `w = (NaN − aᵢ)/…` propagates NaN — the cores' documented NaN semantics.
# The oop test file pins these against the scalar cores over dense query sweeps
# (in-range, knots, both clamps, NaN).
#
# `q` may be a lane vector OR a scalar (an invariant query) — broadcast serves
# both, exactly like the rest of this emitter.

# (`_Interp*LaneSpec`, registered_functions.jl). Same locate → gather → blend
# through the SAME seams, with every scalar knot read (`axis[k]` / `table[k]` /
# `xs[k]`) replaced by its length-L lane COLUMN (`col[k][l] == specs[l].…[k]`).
# All the selects are elementwise, so lane `l` computes exactly what the
# scalar-spec evaluator computes on `specs[l]` — bit-identical to the unmerged
# kernels by construction. The columns are host `Vector{Float64}` constants, so
# a Reactant trace embeds them as constant tensors exactly like scalar knots,
# and the emitted program stays independent of the lane count's origin. `q` may
# be a lane vector OR an invariant scalar; the columns force a length-L result
# either way (each lane still owns its own table).
#
# CLAMP/EDGE BOUNDS are the exception to "every knot read is a seam": the outer
# clamp (`ax[1]`/`ax[Nx]`, and the linear form's edge values `table[1]`/
# `table[n]`) is a plain broadcast over the boundary COLUMN, so under a trace
# each such column would be embedded as a lane-wide constant even when every lane
# holds the same bound — the one remaining O(lanes) constant after the knot/table
# gathers went grid-independent (see test/reactant_lane_dedup_test.jl).
# `_oop_lane_bound` collapses a boundary column whose lanes are all BITWISE
# equal (`isequal` per element: NaN unifies, `-0.0` stays apart from `0.0` —
# the same key the trace-time lane dedup groups by) to its one scalar, which a
# trace then embeds as a scalar constant. Bit-identical by construction: the
# broadcasts consume one value per lane either way, and it is the same value.
# RESULT LENGTH is unchanged in every case — the length-L knot columns flow
# through `_oop_knot_count`/`_oop_knot_pair`/`_oop_bilinear_corners` on every
# path, so the lane axis is carried by the located/gathered terms even when a
# collapsed bound meets a lane-invariant scalar query (the `Lq` trap the
# Reactant ext's `_rx_knot_matrix` guard documents). A mixed column (lanes
# genuinely differing in their bound) stays a column — exactly today.
# `ESS_LANE_INTERN_DISABLE=1` turns the collapse off with the rest of the
# lane-intern feature, restoring today's lane-wide bounds as the oracle.

# ---- interp.* over lanes, ON HOST: just call the core per lane ---------------
#
# The six evaluators above are the TRACER's lowering, and they are branch-free
# because a tracer cannot branch on a traced query. Nothing else needs that.
# When the value type is a plain `Real` — `Float64`, or a ForwardDiff `Dual`,
# i.e. every host and AD walk — the query is a host value and the lane loop may
# simply BRANCH, which is what the scalar `_interp_*_core` kernels already do.
# (`Reactant`'s `TracedRNumber <: Number` but NOT `<: Real`, so a trace never
# reaches these methods; they are strictly a host dispatch.)
#
# BIT-IDENTICAL by construction, not by argument: these call the SAME
# `_oop_interp_*` wrappers — hence the same `_interp_*_core` kernels — that the
# scalar `:fn` arm and `f!` call, which is precisely what the branch-free forms
# are documented (and tested) to reproduce. Broadcast serves a lane vector and
# an invariant scalar query alike, exactly as the ladders did; the per-LANE spec
# forms broadcast over `h.specs`, so lane `l` reads its own table.

# ---- Live forcing buffers as ARGUMENTS (B2) ----------------------------------
#
# The compiled IR reaches a live forcing buffer (`param_arrays` entries and
# DiscreteMaterializer caches, both registered in the build's `pgather` dict) by
# ALIAS: an `_NK_PARAM_GATHER` payload and the `arr` field of a forcing acc
# descriptor (`_AK_ARR_FIXED` / `_AK_FORCING_BOX` / `_AK_ARR_TBL_BOX`) are the
# same host `Vector{Float64}` the caller bound. On host that aliasing IS the
# live-refresh channel. Under an XLA trace it is the silent-staleness bug: a
# captured host array is a trace-time CONSTANT.
#
# So the out-of-place RHS carries the buffers through its ARGUMENT LIST instead:
# the explicit form is `rhs(u, p, t, buffers)`, where `buffers` is a NamedTuple
# of arrays in a STABLE order (buffer names sorted; see `_make_rhs_oop`). At each
# read site the walker swaps the node's aliased host array for the aligned entry
# of the `buffers` argument via `_oop_forcing_slab` — an identity (`===`) scan
# over `hostkeys`, the host buffers in the container's own order (built once per
# RHS). A LINEAR scan, not an `IdDict`, and that is load-bearing: the scan runs
# per forcing read per call, O(#buffers) with #buffers the handful of forcing
# VARIABLES (never cells) — and an `IdDict` capture is untraceable (its
# `Memory{Any}` hash table throws inside Reactant's closure walk), which would
# break tracing for every model, forcing or not. A backend passes device arrays
# (`ConcreteRArray`s) in `buffers`, and an in-place `copyto!` into those SAME
# arrays between calls is a real input update the compiled program sees (see
# ext/EarthSciASTReactantExt.jl).
#
# The host wrapper (`_OopRHS`) forwards the build's own host buffers, so
# `f(u, p, t)` still reads the exact aliased storage it always did — the
# fallback arm in `_oop_forcing_slab` (an arr absent from `hostkeys`, e.g. a
# hand-built test kernel) reads the host array directly, the pre-B2 behavior.
#
# The third field is the per-call READ MEMO (ess-oop-intern; see the
# `_oop_gather` seam). It rides here because this is the one per-call context
# object the walker already threads to every read site, and because that makes
# the memo's lifetime exactly one RHS invocation with no global state and no
# teardown. `M === Nothing` on host and the field is zero-sized, so a host build
# is unchanged in layout, allocation and code.

#

# same way it does under `f!` — the OOP form keeps CSE rather than re-walking shared
# subexpressions. `f!` reads the same slots out of a `Vector{Float64}` captured on
# the node; here they come from a `Vector{T}` allocated per call, which is what makes

# it needs the same lowering here to stay bit-identical to `f!`.

# equation lowers to when it declines the kernel path (a runtime contraction
# loop routes there BY DESIGN, see resolve.jl's `_ARRAY_CELL_DEPTH` note), and
# the per-column `scalars` of a materialized-observed fill level — is walked one
# entry at a time through `_oop_eval`. Correct, and on host cheap; under a TRACE
# it is the one remaining place the emitted program's size scales with the grid:
# every entry re-traces its whole tree, so a contraction loop over L levels
# inside a per-column fill emits O(columns × L) scalar-indexed reads — tens of
# `stablehlo.dynamic_slice` ops per grid cell, which is what makes XLA compile
# time blow up on a real grid.
#
# WHAT. Those entries are per-cell INSTANTIATIONS of one expression: same tree,
# same ops, same loop ranges — only the baked-in cell data differ (state slots,
# forcing offsets, gather subscripts, inlined per-cell constants). So at closure
# build the entries are GROUPED by a canonical structural signature
# (`_oop_batch_sig`) that wildcards exactly those lane-varying leaves, each
# group is lowered ONCE to a lane-batched tree (`_OopBatchNode`,
# `_oop_batch_lower`), and the whole group evaluates through `_oop_eval_batch`
# as whole-array ops over its lane axis: a state leaf is ONE `_oop_gather` over
# the per-lane slots, a contraction loop runs its L iterations ONCE with a
# whole-lane accumulate per iteration, and the group's result lands through ONE
# `_oop_scatter`. Emitted-program size: O(tree × L), independent of the lane
# (grid) count.
#
# BIT-IDENTITY. Per lane, every arm performs the same operations in the same
# order the scalar walker performs them (broadcast is elementwise; the loop
# fold accumulates per lane in the same ascending-k order seeded from the same
# 0̄; a ghost state-gather selects the same 0; a pow keeps its literal exponent
# — the signature PINS the exponent, so a group never blends the power rule).
# The one semantic divergence is inherited from every vectorized tier of this
# codebase: `ifelse`/`and`/`or` evaluate EAGERLY over lanes (the `_oop_op`
# folded arms, value-identical to the lazy scalar arms) rather than
# short-circuiting, so a guard that exists to dodge a DomainError does not
# dodge it here — exactly the `_eval_acc` / `_oop_run_acc_vec` contract. Under
# a trace the lazy arms could not run anyway (branching on a traced Bool
# throws), so for the traced consumer this path is strictly more capable.
#
# SAFETY. Grouping is conservative: a signature mismatch, a singleton group, an
# unknown node kind, or any congruence check failing in `_oop_batch_lower`
# leaves the affected entries on the existing one-at-a-time scalar path,
# unchanged. `ESS_OOP_BATCH=0` disables the whole feature (every entry single).
# Entries within one batch surface write DISJOINT slots and never read each
# other (rhs_list writes `du` reading only `ue`/cache; a fill level's scalars
# read only strictly-lower levels — the level scheduler's invariant), so
# evaluating groups after the leftover singles reorders only WRITES to disjoint
# slots, never a read-after-write.

# ---- The closure ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Mirrors `_make_rhs` phase for phase (CSE prelude → scalar equations → array
# kernels) so the two emitters cannot diverge in evaluation ORDER, only in storage.
# States with no `D(...)` equation keep `du = 0`, as under `f!`.
#
# Every touch of the output goes through the `_oop_du_zeros` / `_oop_store` /
# `_oop_scatter` seams above, and the closure REBINDS `du` from each — so a backend
# whose output is immutable (a traced value) is expressible here without a second
# closure. At Float64 the seams are the inline code they replaced.
#
# NO CONST-CADENCE TIER HERE, AND THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT (4qf). `f!` skips its
# const prelude slots when `p` has not moved because it refills a buffer it OWNS
# across calls — the values from the previous call are still sitting in it. This
# emitter's cache is a `Vector{T}` allocated FRESH on every call, and it must be: a
# captured host buffer is precisely what makes `f!` untraceable (see property 1 at the
# top of this file), and under tracing `T` is the backend's traced scalar type, so a
# cross-call buffer would be carrying traced values from one trace into the next. There
# is nothing valid to skip TO. So every slot is refilled, in ascending slot order —
# which is the const tier's two loops with the skip permanently disabled, hence
# numerically identical to `f!` (the tests pin `:inplace` ≡ `:oop`) and never stale.
# The same reasoning covers the B3 TIME tier: with a per-call cache there is nothing
# valid to skip to, so `:oop` refills time slots every call too — and is therefore
# also the natural untiered oracle for the t-tier differential tests. The build still
# REPORTS `n_const_slots` / `n_time_slots` / `n_dynamic_slots` for an `:oop` build;
# the classification is a property of the prelude, not of the emitter.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# J5 — REFUSE TO BE XLA-COMPILED WHILE A LIVE FORCING BUFFER IS A CAPTURE.
#
# A `_NK_PARAM_GATHER` payload is an ALIASED HOST `Vector{Float64}` — the same
# object the caller passed through `param_arrays`, so that a discrete-cadence
# refresh callback's in-place `buffer .= …` is seen by the RHS with zero
# reallocation. That aliasing is the whole point of the channel, and it is
# exactly what an XLA tracer cannot honour: to the tracer a captured host vector
# is a CONSTANT, so `@compile` bakes the buffer's compile-time contents into the
# program and the refresh is never seen again.
#
# The failure mode is the dangerous one — not an exception, not a NaN, but THE
# SAME NUMBERS FOREVER, off by the full magnitude of every forcing update. A
# silently wrong answer is worse than no answer, so this refuses.
#
# The SUPPORTED tracing route (B2) is the explicit-buffers form: `rhs_with_buffers`
# hands out `rhs(u, p, t, buffers)`, and a trace that passes TRACED buffers (the
# `buffers` argument arrives Reactant-rooted) is legal — every forcing read then
# lands on a real XLA input, and `copyto!` into those same device arrays at each
# cadence boundary IS seen by the compiled program. The refusal therefore fires
# only when a trace reaches the walk while the buffers are still HOST arrays —
# i.e. the 3-arg wrapper (which forwards its captured host buffers) or an
# explicit call that passed host buffers under tracing.
#
# The refusal fires during the TRACE (i.e. inside `@compile`), not at build time,
# because build time cannot distinguish the consumers: the interpreted
# out-of-place closure over a `param_arrays` model is perfectly correct and DOES
# track the refresh — `reactant_oop_test.jl` asserts exactly that — so refusing at
# `build_evaluator` would reject a working configuration.
#
# `_is_traced` deliberately does not depend on Reactant: it asks whether the
# argument's type comes from the Reactant module at all. ForwardDiff `Dual`s and
# Enzyme's shadows are NOT Reactant types, so AD is untouched.

# ---- Affine access kernels, out of place (ess-affine) -----------------------
#
# TWO FORMS, chosen per kernel at closure build:
#
#   * The VECTORIZED (de-scalarized) form — `_oop_run_acc_vec` below — the
#     default. Every state read is a whole-array `_oop_gather(u, slots)` with
#     slot vectors precomputed on host from the kernel's affine descriptors,
#     every op is the shared broadcast ladder, interp leaves are the
#     locate→gather→blend lane forms, and the kernel's whole result lands
#     through ONE `_oop_scatter`. NOTHING scalar-indexes `u` per cell, so an
#     XLA/Reactant trace of a DEFAULT (affine) build emits a program whose size
#     is independent of the grid.
#
#   * The PER-CELL fallback — `_oop_run_acc_kernel` — the functional twin of
#     `_run_acc_kernel!`: same cell walk, same eltype-generic `_eval_acc` spine,
#     each value landing through the `_oop_store` seam. Correct on host
#     (Float64 / ForwardDiff `Dual`); under a trace its per-cell scalar reads
#     fail LOUDLY in Reactant rather than silently.
#
#     Two classes still take this fallback (gordian total-vectorize closed the
#     ghost-bearing state table — it now vectorizes by gather-then-select):
#       - VARIABLE-VALENCE reductions / unstructured indirect gathers (`_NK_REDUCE`
#         with a per-cell neighbour count, `_AK_STATE_INDIRECT[_COL]`, `_AK_CONST_
#         EDGE`). A whole-array form needs a SEGMENTED gather+reduce (CSR-style)
#         that reproduces `_eval_acc`'s seeded, child-ORDERED ⊕-fold bit for bit;
#         a padded rectangular reduce would reorder the fold. Left as a fallback
#         rather than risk a fold-order divergence across the semiring/aggregate/
#         join corpus.
#       - TEMPLATE SUB-KERNEL calls (`K.subs` non-empty / `_NK_SUBCALL`). Needs the
#         sub-kernel evaluated as its own whole-array op over the parent's lanes
#         and its result array spliced into the parent operand stream (per
#         (variant, region), shared). The in-place codegen emitter declines
#         these the same way (sub-kernel spines carry foreign scratch); this
#         path does not vectorize them either.

# off, every structure below is the empty singleton and every guarded branch
# folds to the pre-existing path, so the emitted program is unchanged.
#
# WHAT THIS REMOVES. The materialized-observed prelude communicates through the
# flat extended vector `ue`: every fill kernel's whole result is scattered into
# it (`_oop_scatter` — under a trace a whole-buffer `dynamic_update_slice` /
# concatenate rewrite), and every consumer reads it back out through a dense
# precomputed gather (`plan.gathers`). `ue` is a pure implementation artifact —
# the RHS returns only `du` — yet on a merged-class chemistry build the traffic
# through it dominates the compiled step (measured on ReSEACT at 288 cells:
# 58.3% of the optimized module's element volume is data movement, and the
# gather index constants alone are ~17 kB/cell). The gather index vectors are
# affine lattices: mostly runs of consecutive slots, each run lying inside ONE
# producer kernel's contiguous output block. So a consumer can reference its
# producer's RESULT VALUE directly — the whole value when the descriptor reads
# exactly one producer's block, a slice (or a few slices concatenated) when it
# reads part of it — and the scatter into `ue` is emitted only where something
# genuinely still reads the flat buffer.
#
# THREE TIERS, decided per consumer DESCRIPTOR at build time:
#   1. direct: the gather is one producer's entire block ⇒ the producer's SSA
#      value, no op at all;
#   2. slice: the gather decomposes into few consecutive-position runs, each
#      inside one producer ⇒ per-run slices (+ one concatenate when > 1);
#   3. fallback: anything else — non-affine tables, ghost-masked gathers,
#      E-lane (in-reduce) and sub-kernel reads, scalar-walker reads — keeps the
#      existing dense gather from `ue`, byte-for-byte.
#
# SOUNDNESS RESTS ON THREE STATIC FACTS, all established by the existing build:
#   * a fill level reads the state and STRICTLY LOWER levels only (the
#     `_oop_fill_level` contract), so a producer's value exists before any
#     redirect to it runs — enforced here by requiring producer.level <
#     consumer.level (the state prefix `u` is level 0);
#   * slot ownership is LAST-writer: a slot rewritten later (another kernel, a
#     level's scalar fills, a level scan fold) is either owned by that later
#     writer or disowned, and the level check above then refuses any redirect
#     that would observe the wrong write;
#   * a producer's scatter into `ue` is skipped ONLY when static accounting
#     shows every read of its block was redirected — every non-redirected read
#     surface (scalar `_Node` walks, E-lane/sub-kernel plans, `_AK_STATE_FIXED`
#     pins, ghost gathers, level scan folds, declined descriptors) marks its
#     slots as residual, and ANY per-cell (non-vectorizable) kernel disables
#     skipping wholesale, because its reads cannot be enumerated.
#
# BIT-IDENTITY. A redirected read returns the exact array the scatter would
# have copied into `ue` (or a slice of it), so consumer arithmetic sees the
# same values in the same order; the host `:oop` ≡ `:inplace` pin holds with
# the flag on, and the SSA test asserts it across the corpus.
#
# The RUNTIME residue is small by design: producer values live in one per-call
# `Vector{Any}` (`vals`, entry 1 = the raw state `u`), recorded as each
# producer runs; a producer whose spine hoisted to a lane-invariant SCALAR
# records `nothing` and always scatters, and every redirect then falls back to
# the (still valid) gather at run time — so the build-time `skip` decision
# never outruns what actually happened.

# Per-kernel build-time SSA role: its producer id (0 ⇒ untracked), whether its

calling `f(u, p, t)` does), or an aligned NamedTuple of device arrays

program each buffer is a real XLA input, so an in-place `copyto!` into those
same device arrays between calls — see [`sync_forcing!`](@ref) — IS observed on

# empty view of the caller's — allocating a fresh empty vector per level per call
# would defeat the point of the seam.
