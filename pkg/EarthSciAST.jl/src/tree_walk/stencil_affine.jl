# tree_walk/stencil_affine.jl — part of the tree-walk evaluator (ess-affine).
# Included by src/tree_walk.jl AFTER stencil.jl; see that file for the layout.
#
# The POLYHEDRAL affine build: turn a lowered `makearray` rule body into a small
# set of `_AccKernel`s (access_kernel.jl) in O(#structural groups), NOT O(#cells).
# This is the replacement for the per-cell / per-branch symbolic-stencil path
# (stencil.jl), whose cost is O(#cells × body) and made the monotone-PPM build
# take tens of minutes (see esd-ess-build-oom-memoless-substitution).
#
# HOW IT WILL WORK (the box processor, built incrementally):
#   1. Reuse `_build_branch_template` (stencil.jl) to compile ONE sentinel spine
#      per structural signature — a `_Node` tree whose loop-var-dependent gather
#      leaves are `_NK_STATE(idx = -k)` placeholders (lane k ↔ `recipes[k]`).
#   2. Decompose the index space into BOXES on which the region selection, the
#      ghost pattern, and every gather's affine Δ are CONSTANT. Cut points per
#      loop dim come from region + ghost boundaries (an O(N) per-dim line sweep);
#      the product of per-dim intervals is the candidate box set.
#   3. Per box: evaluate the lane recipes at the box's REPRESENTATIVE cell to get
#      each gather's slot / const value / ghost flag, and DERIVE its access
#      descriptor by finite differences (Δ = slot(rep) − oln(rep) for state; per-
#      dim strides from unit-step differences for a const on its own grid). VERIFY
#      the derivation is uniform across the box CORNERS; if not, fall back.
#   4. Lower the sentinel spine to an access spine with `_lower_to_access` (below)
#      and emit one `_AccKernel` with the box's `_CellSet`.
#
# `_lower_to_access` keeps the spine's tree shape, but each `_NK_STATE(idx=-k)`
# lane leaf becomes either a literal (ghost / invariant-folded lane) or an
# `_NK_ACCESS` into a per-kernel descriptor table,
# and each invariant fixed-slot leaf (`_NK_STATE idx≥0`, `_NK_PARAM_GATHER`)
# becomes a fixed-read descriptor. Because the spine's OP structure is the exact
# `_compile` output (only leaves are swapped), the arithmetic — operand order,
# associativity, n-ary grouping — is byte-for-byte the per-cell path's, which is
# what makes the emitted kernel bit-identical.
# ========================================================================

# Per-lane lowering decision, computed by the box processor from the recipe
# values at the box's representative cell: a lane is either a constant (a ghost
# gather → 0.0, or a value that is invariant across the box) or an access
# descriptor resolved per cell at runtime.

# Lower a compiled sentinel template `tmpl` to an access spine, appending each
# access leaf's descriptor to `acc` (the kernel's descriptor table, `_NK_ACCESS.idx`
# indexes it). `lane_repl[k]` is the lowering decision for lane sentinel k
# (`_NK_STATE(idx = -k)`). Non-lane leaves:
#   * `_NK_STATE(idx ≥ 0)`     invariant fixed state slot  → `_AccStateFixed`
#   * `_NK_PARAM_GATHER`       invariant forcing gather    → `_AccArrFixed`
#   * `_NK_LITERAL/PARAM/TIME`  pass through (the access evaluator handles them)
#   * `_NK_OP :fn` (interp)     op node carrying its `(fname, spec)` payload
# Anything not modelled (a contraction node) throws `_StencilFallback` so the
# caller runs the per-cell path — never a wrong kernel.
#
# IDENTITY-MEMOIZED (ESS-0hh): the compiled template is a DAG (`_stencilize` /
# `_compile` preserve sharing via their identity memos), and the lowering is a
# pure function of the node under one call's fixed `lane_repl`/`subcalls`, so
# a shared template node lowers to ONE shared access node — the per-path
# rebuild re-inflated the spine into an exponentially large tree AND pushed a
# duplicate `acc` descriptor per PATH to each access leaf. With the memo a
# shared leaf pushes its descriptor once and every parent references that
# entry; evaluation reads `acc[idx]` by index, so values are unchanged, and
# `_build_acc_cse` counts path multiplicities exactly, so CSE slot decisions
# are unchanged too. On a tree (no shared nodes) the memo never hits —
# byte-identical output, `acc` table included. The memo is per top-level
# call; `_lower_subcall` re-enters through this entry so a variant body gets
# its own memo for its own `lane_repl`.

# ── LANE-AFFINE SIGNATURE (the cut key measures the LANE, not the output) ─────
#
# The gather key historically recorded, per STATE lane, `Δ = slot − oln` — the
# lane's slot relative to the OUTPUT cell's slot. That is the right key only for
# a gather from an array laid out exactly like the output: a Cartesian stencil
# neighbour. It is the WRONG key for a gather whose array has a DIFFERENT shape
# from the output's — a lower-rank geometry column (`coslat_e[j]` read from an
# (i,j,k) loop), a staggered face field (`Mx` on (NLON+1, NLAT, NLEV)), a 2-D
# surface field. Those slots are perfectly affine in the loop indices, but with
# their OWN strides, so `Δ` moves at every cell and the signature reads a
# transition where there is none. Two costs follow, both O(grid):
#
#   * the edge-inward cut scan never stabilises (the key changes at every cell),
#     so it walks the whole half-range of every axis instead of stopping after
#     `_AFFINE_STABLE_GUARD` cells — the scan becomes O(axis length);
#   * every scanned axis is cut into segments up to the `_AFFINE_MAX_DELTA_SEGS`
#     cap, so the box count grows with the grid and every per-box cost
#     (branch key, corner verification, lane derivation, spine memo key) is paid
#     once per box.
#
# The fix keys each lane by its SUBSCRIPTS' own local behaviour instead: a
# subscript that is STRUCTURALLY affine in the loop indices (`+ - neg *` over
# loop names and integer literals) can never open a cut and is skipped outright,
# and any other subscript contributes its per-dim BACKWARD DIFFERENCE
# `v(loop) − v(loop − e_d)`. That difference is constant wherever the subscript
# is affine — no cut, at any grid size — and changes exactly at the cell where a
# clamp / fold / wrap engages, which is exactly where the box processor's corner
# verification would fail. It is reference-free by construction: keying the
# deviation from an affine model derived at some probe cell silently poisons the
# scan whenever that probe sits on the clamped side of the transition being
# looked for. Ghost membership (a state slot resolving to 0) keeps its own bit,
# as before. `ESS_LANE_AFFINE_KEY_DISABLE=1` restores the Δ-keyed signature byte
# for byte.

# else (a clamp `max(k-1,1)`, a fold, a `mod`, a gather through a const table, a
# division, a registered function) is classified NON-affine and DOES get its

# not model a gather whose array has a DIFFERENT shape: a lower-rank geometry
# column (`coslat_e[j]` read from an (i,j,k) loop), a staggered face field on
# (NLON+1, NLAT, NLEV), a 2-D surface field. Those slots are affine in the loop
# indices too, but with the ARRAY's own strides, so `Δ` is not constant and the
# derivation below fell through to a dense per-box slot table — one
# `_eval_recipe` and one stored `Int` per box CELL, per lane. On ReSEACT
# transport that is the single largest grid-dependent term in the build
# (4.49 M table entries at 18x12x72 — 289 per cell — all of them state gathers
# of exactly this shape).
#
# The const and live-forcing branches already have the right descriptor for
# this: `_AccConstBox` / `_AccForcingBox` address their own grid as
# `off + Σ(midx_d−1)·s_d`. `_AccStateTblBox` has the same addressing, and its
# `conn` table only has to map that address to a slot — so a lane whose slot is
# affine in the loop needs no per-cell table at all: it needs the strides, and a
# table that is the IDENTITY over the variable's own slot block. That block is
# one dense contiguous run per array variable (`_enumerate_array_cell_names`
# lays cells out column-major, contiguously), it is shared by every lane, every
# box and every equation of the build through the pool below, and it is the same
# size as the variable — never O(#cells) per lane.
