# never `setindex!`/`push!`/`merge!` into one. Writing to a sentinel would
# silently leak state into every later build in the process. Code paths that
# need a mutable dict must branch to a fresh instance (see e.g. the
# `derived_extents` selection in `_build_evaluator_impl`). The invariant is

# state-variable gather, which honors grid periodicity (periodic-wrap) and applies
# a finite boundary policy at non-periodic edges. The covariant-FV connection
# terms gather metric factors at lat±1 / lon±1 offsets; on a lon-periodic metric
# those must WRAP, and at a non-periodic lat pole they must edge-extend — the
# zero-ghost convention is physically wrong for a metric.
#
# Per-dimension policy symbols:
#   :periodic — wrap the index into 1..N via mod1; correct for a periodic axis.
#   :clamp    — edge-extend (clamp to 1..N); the correct finite policy for a
#               metric/geometry factor at a non-periodic boundary.
#   :error    — throw E_TREEWALK_CONSTARRAY_OOB (default for any array WITHOUT a

# ---- `broadcast` lowering (esm-spec §4.3.4) -----------------------------------
# `{"op":"broadcast","fn":F,"args":[…]}` applies the SCALAR operator `F`
# element-wise to its operands. That is exactly what a bare `{"op":F,"args":[…]}`
# node already means on this path — the leaf-indexing rewrites gather every array
# operand per cell (name-aligned, see `_AxisAlign`) and leave genuine scalars
# alone — so `broadcast` is LOWERED to its `fn` op at the entry to the build and
# never reaches the evaluator as a distinct node. Lowering (rather than teaching
# every ladder a `broadcast` arm) is what makes the spec's identity
# `broadcast(fn=F, [x]) ≡ F(x)` true BY CONSTRUCTION: one node kind, one set of
# arms, one CSE/fold/stencil classification.
#
# The `fn` contract is checked here (`_broadcast_fn_problem`, op_registry.jl —
# the same predicate `validate()` reports as `invalid_broadcast_fn`), so a bogus
# `fn` is a BUILD error even for a caller that never ran `validate()`.
# `reshape`/`transpose`/`concat` are NOT lowered — they are genuine shape ops
# with no scalar-operator spelling, and keep their `E_TREEWALK_UNSUPPORTED_OP`
# rejection in `_compile_op`.
#
# DAG-SAFE, WITHOUT TAXING THE COMMON CASE (ESS-0hh).
# `map_children` already declines to REBUILD an unchanged node, which keeps a
# shared DAG shared on the way out — but the WALK itself was per-PATH, so a node
# reachable by 2^d paths was re-entered 2^d times even when nothing changed and
# nothing was rebuilt. dag_walk_memo_test.jl's depth-32 chain pins that case.
#
# The obvious fix — memoize every node on identity — is sound (the rewrite is a
# pure, context-free function of the node) but it is NOT free: an `IdDict` probe
# plus insert per node costs several times the un-memoized walk on trees with no
# sharing, and an ordinary model's equations are exactly that shape. Paying a
# constant-factor tax on every build to defend against a pathological one is the
# wrong trade.
#
# So: walk UN-MEMOIZED under a visit BUDGET, and only if the budget is exhausted
# — which only a shared DAG with an exponential path count can do — redo the walk
# memoized. Both paths compute the same function, so which one ran is
# unobservable except in time and in SHARING: the memoized path maps a node
# reached twice to the same output object rather than two equal copies, which is
# the DAG-preserving direction and already what the unchanged case did.
#
# So an unshared tree pays only one `Ref` decrement per node, and a doubling DAG
# pays the budget once before switching to the linear memoized walk. That burn is
# a one-time CONSTANT, not a scaling term. Tripping the budget is not an error
# condition — a legitimately huge single expression simply takes the memoized
# path, which is the linear one.

# Elementwise scalar ops whose ARRAY-shaped observed the WS4 fold may inline: the
# arithmetic / transcendental functions that broadcast per cell. An array observed
# whose top-level op is anything else — a producer (`makearray`/`arrayop`/
# `aggregate`), a `const` field, a geometry kernel (`intersect_polygon`, …), a
# gather/reshape (`index`, `reshape`, `transpose`, `concat`, `broadcast`), a
# value-invention op (`skolem`/`distinct`/`rank`), or a bare alias — is left to
# its own dedicated handler (const_arrays, `_array_inline_vars`, geometry setup,
# the bare-alias path). Restricting the fold to this allowlist keeps it provably
# regression-free: an elementwise array observed was previously REJECTED
# (`E_TREEWALK_UNSUPPORTED_SHAPE`), so no prior-passing build exercised one.
#
# INVARIANT: every op here MUST have a scalar arm in `_eval_node_op` (and hence a
# matching arm in `_eval_acc_op`) — the fold inlines the op into a state RHS,
# so a non-evaluable op would convert a clear build-time UNSUPPORTED_SHAPE error
# into a runtime UNSUPPORTED_OP after folding. The set therefore holds only the
# esm-spec §4.2 evaluable-core elementwise ops (plus the canonicalize-internal
# `neg`/`pow` aliases). Membership is declared per-op in src/op_registry.jl
# (flag `:ws4_foldable`) and pinned by op_registry_test.jl; the containment
# invariant above is pinned by tree_walk_op_table_test.jl.

# ---- Index push-down: which operand of an `index` gather is ARRAY-valued? ----
# Shared predicate of the two `index(<elementwise op>, k…)` push-down branches —
# `_resolve_indices_op` (resolve.jl) and `_stencilize_index` (stencil.jl). Both
# distribute a gather over an elementwise combination,
#
#     index(op(a, b, …), k…)  ->  op(index(a, k…), index(b, k…), …)
#
# and both need to know WHICH operands to wrap: an array-valued one is gathered,
# a genuinely scalar one (a literal, a scalar parameter) broadcasts and must be
# left alone. `is_array_leaf(name) -> Bool` is the caller's own array-VARIABLE
# test (an array state slot, a forcing buffer, a const array), which is the only
# part that differs between the two sites.
#
# An expression is array-valued here when it is
#
#   * an array PRODUCER node — a `makearray`, or an `aggregate`/`arrayop` that
#     keeps at least one symbolic output index (a SCALAR reduction, whose
#     `output_idx` is empty, produces a scalar and must NOT be gathered); or
#   * a variable leaf the caller recognizes as an array; or
#   * an ELEMENTWISE combination (`_is_scalar_op`) that is array-valued by this
#     same rule at any depth.
#
# The last clause is the point. The two sites used to test only the IMMEDIATE
# operands, so `index(1 + cos(pi*zc), j)` — the shape an elementwise-defined
# array observed (`f = 1 + cos(pi*zc)`) takes once
# `_fold_elementwise_array_observeds` inlines it into a reader that gathers it,
# `index(f, j)` — matched nothing: `1` is a literal and `cos(pi*zc)` is neither a
# producer node nor a variable, so no operand was wrapped, the gather was
# dropped, and the array leaf `zc` survived bare into `_compile` as
# `E_TREEWALK_UNBOUND_VARIABLE: zc` (issue #175). Recursing through elementwise
# ops sees `zc` under the `cos`, wraps `cos(pi*zc)` whole, and the re-resolution
# of `index(cos(pi*zc), j)` pushes the gather down the same way until it lands on
# the leaf as `1 + cos(pi*index(zc, j))`. Distribution is exact for an
# elementwise op, so this is the same value the explicit gather spelling would
# have produced.
#
# IDENTITY-MEMOIZED over `OpExpr` (the ESS-0hh convention): the folded body is a
# structurally-shared DAG, and `any` over a shared subtree would otherwise be
# re-walked once per path. One memo per push-down decision — `is_array_leaf` is
# fixed within it.
# A const-array registry entry that holds exactly ONE element is a SCALAR field,
# not a gatherable array: `_resolve_indices(::VarExpr)` const-folds a bare
# reference to it to its literal value (the RFC pure-io-data-loaders §4.3 0-D
# loader field). It must therefore stay OUT of an index push-down's leaf test —
# wrapping it would gather a 1-element array at the enclosing loop's subscript
# and read out of range for every cell but the first. A size-1 INDEX SET is the
# same object and the same answer: its only legal subscript is 1, which is what
# the const-fold already returns.

# equation RHS is an ELEMENTWISE expression — top-level op in
# `_WS4_FOLDABLE_ELEMENTWISE_OPS` — into the equations that read it, in dependency
# order, returning `(rewritten_equations, folded_names)`.
#
# This lets a library PDE leaf be authored with readable intermediate array fields
# (a level-set's `grad_safe = grad_mag + ε`, `U_n = (u·∇ψ)/grad_safe`,
# `S_n = R_0·(1+φ_W+φ_S)`) instead of one monolithic inlined `D(ψ,t)` RHS — the
# evaluator otherwise rejects such an observed as `E_TREEWALK_UNSUPPORTED_SHAPE`
# (only a producer-defined array observed inlines, via `_array_inline_vars`, and
# only a clip ring materializes). Array observeds defined by a bare array PRODUCER
# (the discretized `psi_x = D(ψ,x)`, `grad_mag = sqrt(D(ψ,x)²+D(ψ,y)²)`, both
# lowered to `makearray` by the mounted scheme) are LEFT UNTOUCHED — they define
# their own per-cell indexing and are inlined by the `_array_inline_vars` index
# beta-reduction downstream. So the fold pulls only the elementwise combinators
# into the state equation, whose whole-array lift then indexes the surviving
# producer refs per cell — reproducing the hand-inlined RHS the leaf used to carry.
#
# This is the model-level counterpart of `inline_elementwise_array_observeds`
# (shape_promotion.jl). Runs after observed-equation synthesis and before the
# whole-array derivative lift. Byte-identical (empty fold, same equations vector)
# for any model with no elementwise array observed.
