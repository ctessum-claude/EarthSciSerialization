XLA tracing for the OUT-OF-PLACE RHS (`build_evaluator(model; form = :oop)`,
src/tree_walk/oop.jl), loaded automatically when `Reactant` is in the session.

UPSTREAM DEFECTS THIS EXTENSION WORKS AROUND are catalogued in UPSTREAM_ISSUES.md,
together with what each one unblocks here and what it does NOT. Read it before
adding a workaround, and before concluding that a cost centre is upstream's fault —
most of the compile cost seen so far has been emitter shape in THIS repository.

WHAT THIS EXTENSION IS. Methods on the SEAMS the out-of-place walker already routes
every state read, `du` write, interp knot read and emitted op through (the `import`
list below is the full set). Not a second evaluator: `@compile`ing `f` runs the SAME tree walk, on the SAME compiled IR, with
`TracedRNumber`/`TracedRArray` in place of `Float64`/`Vector{Float64}` — the walk
executes once, at TRACE time, and what XLA gets is the flat op graph it left behind.
That is the whole reason the emitter is eltype-generic and buffer-free; `f!` cannot
be traced at all, because it captures concrete `Vector{Float64}` scratch buffers (the
CSE prelude and the access kernels' `_AccCSE` tiers) and XLA has nothing to do with a
host buffer.

WHY THESE FIVE AND NOTHING ELSE. Everything in between — `_oop_op`'s broadcast ladder,
CSE, the semiring folds, the invariant hoist — is already legal StableHLO: broadcasting
`TracedRArray`s traces to elementwise ops, and `_oop_value_type` resolves to
`TracedRNumber{Float64}` on its own (`promote_type` over Reactant's number type does the
right thing), so `convert(T, literal)`, `zero(T)`, `one(T)` all trace. What is NOT legal
is exactly the container boundary:

  * SCALAR INDEXING of a traced array is REJECTED, not slow — Reactant errors with
    "Scalar indexing is disallowed" rather than silently emitting a per-element read.
    `_oop_read_state` / `_oop_store` are the only two places the walker does it, and
    both do it O(#scalar states) times (never O(#cells) — a lane axis goes through
    `_oop_gather`/`_oop_scatter`, which are whole-array ops and trace as-is). So
    `@allowscalar` here is a narrow, bounded assertion, not a blanket opt-out: it says
    "this index is on the scalar spine of the model", and the program size stays
    independent of the grid, which is the property the compiled IR exists to have.

  * The OUTPUT CONTAINER cannot come from `similar`. Under tracing
    `T === TracedRNumber{Float64}`, and `similar(u, T, n)` is a host `Vector` OF traced
    scalars — a Julia array holding trace handles, not a traced array. It has no MLIR
    value, so the trace has no output and the compile fails (or, worse, silently returns
    a constant). `_oop_du_zeros` takes the container from `Reactant.Ops.fill` instead.

LIVE FORCING BUFFERS ARE TRACED ARGUMENTS, NOT CAPTURES (B2). A live forcing
buffer (`param_arrays`, ess-14f.3; a `DiscreteMaterializer` cache is a `pgather`
entry by construction) is bound BY REFERENCE into `_NK_PARAM_GATHER` node payloads
and forcing acc descriptors. Under tracing a CAPTURED host array is a TRACE-TIME
CONSTANT: XLA bakes in whatever the buffer held at `@compile`, the discrete-cadence
refresh callback (src/data_refresh.jl) then writes the buffer in place, and the
compiled program does not see it — silently STALE forcing, no error, plausible
numbers. That defect was demonstrated, then fixed by moving the BINDING, not the
refresh model: the out-of-place RHS now carries an explicit-buffers form,
`rhs_with_buffers(f)(u, p, t, buffers)`, whose `buffers` container (see
`forcing_buffers` / `forcing_buffer_index`) arrives through the ARGUMENT LIST. An
array passed as an argument is a real XLA input, and `copyto!`-ing new values into
that same `ConcreteRArray` between calls IS seen by the already-compiled program
(pinned by test/reactant_oop_test.jl) — so the discrete-cadence model
survives compilation verbatim: one aliased buffer per forcing, refreshed in place at
each cadence boundary (`sync_forcing!` mirrors host → device inside the refresh
callback's `post_refresh` hook), no reallocation, no recompile. (Recompiling at each
boundary "works" and is the trap: silent, O(#boundaries) compiles, and a different
program at each one.)

The usage contract, then:

    fo   = build_evaluator(model; form = :oop, param_arrays = forcing)[1]
    dev  = map(ConcreteRArray, forcing_buffers(fo))
    xla  = @compile rhs_with_buffers(fo)(u_r, p_r, t_r, dev)
    # at each cadence boundary, after the host refresh:
    sync_forcing!(dev, forcing_buffers(fo))

`@compile`-ing the 3-ARG wrapper `fo(u, p, t)` over a live-forcing model still
REFUSES (audit J5): the wrapper forwards its captured HOST buffers, which is
exactly the silent-staleness configuration, so the walk throws
`E_TREEWALK_XLA_LIVE_FORCING` during the trace rather than bake them in. A model
with no `param_arrays` compiles through the 3-arg wrapper as before.

# ---- Parameter reads (the vector `p` ABI) ------------------------------------
#
# The parameter half of the same story as the state read below, and the same
# answer. A vector `p` (`ComponentVector`, `Vector`) is unwrapped to its dense
# data by `_param_data` — for a traced `ComponentVector` that is a `TracedRArray`,
# and a bare `q[idx]` on one raises "Scalar indexing is disallowed" (indexing the
# ComponentVector itself is worse, an ambiguous `getindex`). Under
# `@allowscalar` it traces to a slice + reshape and yields the `TracedRNumber` the
# walker's `convert(T, …)` wants.
#
# The bound that makes `@allowscalar` a narrow assertion rather than a blanket
# opt-out is even tighter here than for the state: this fires O(#PARAMETERS) times
# per RHS — a fact of the DOCUMENT, not of the grid — so the emitted program size
# is untouched by N. Reading a whole parameter vector as one operand would be the
# alternative, and it is the wrong shape: parameters enter the RHS one scalar at a
# time, at nodes scattered through the expression tree.
@inline _read_param_data(d::TracedRArray{T,1}, idx::Int) where {T} =
    @allowscalar d[idx]

# ---- State reads -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The scalar read. `u[i]` on a `TracedRArray` throws; under `@allowscalar` it traces
# to a slice + reshape and yields a `TracedRNumber`, which is what the walker's
# `convert(T, …)` wants. Returning a size-1 SLICE (`u[i:i]`) instead would broadcast
# correctly but is a `TracedRArray`, and `convert(TracedRNumber, ::TracedRArray)` is not
# a thing — so the scalar spine, not the lane axis, is where this method belongs.
@inline _oop_read_state(u::TracedRArray{T,1}, i::Int) where {T} = @allowscalar u[i]

# ---- Read interning: one op per (SSA value, window), per RHS call ------------
#
# The TWO-argument `_oop_gather` still needs no method: `u[slots]` on a
# `TracedRArray` with a host `Vector{Int}` already traces to the right op —
# Reactant's `getindex_linear` emits a `stablehlo.slice` when `slots` is a
# constant-stride run and a `stablehlo.gather` otherwise. The same applies to a
# forcing LANE read (`_AK_FORCING_BOX` / `_AK_ARR_TBL_BOX`): the walker routes it
# through `_oop_gather` over the traced buffers ARGUMENT. What DOES need a method
# is the three-argument form, because emitting the right op is not the same thing
# as emitting it once.
#
# WHY. Most `stablehlo.slice` ops in a raw (`optimize=false`) module are window
# reads of the emitter's flat extended state tensor `ue = [u ; zeros]` — one
# materialized array observed's whole cell block, re-read once per acc-kernel
# descriptor that mentions it — and most of those are exact `(operand, window)`
# duplicates. XLA is left to rediscover the duplication with
# `CSE<mlir::stablehlo::SliceOp>`, which is PAIRWISE over slice ops and therefore
# quadratic in their count, and that pattern dominates compile time on a large
# grid. Interning at emission means the duplicate is never created.
#
# WHY THE KEY IS SOUND — this is the safety-critical part, because a key
# collision returns the WRONG DATA silently.
#
#   * The container half of the key is the operand's CURRENT MLIR SSA VALUE, not
#     the Julia object. A `TracedRArray` is MUTABLE and `setindex!` rebinds its
#     `mlir_data` in place (Reactant `Indexing.jl`), so one Julia object holds
#     different values over its life — `objectid` would alias a pre-write read
#     onto a post-write one, which is exactly the catastrophic case. An SSA value,
#     by contrast, is immutable by construction: `%42` denotes one tensor of one
#     shape with one set of contents for the whole program. Two reads of the same
#     `(value, window)` are therefore the same tensor by definition, and
#     `_oop_scatter` moving the container on changes the key automatically.
#   * The window half is the slot vector ITSELF, compared by CONTENT. The memo is
#     a `Dict`, so a hash collision is resolved by `isequal` on the full vector —
#     the key is verified on every hit, and equal keys are equal windows because
#     `slots` is the complete description of what a gather reads. `length(u)` is
#     in the key too, so an entry can never be served to a differently-shaped
#     operand even in the presence of a stale pointer.
#   * Pointer reuse (ABA) is the one residual hazard: an SSA value's address is
#     the address of the defining op's result storage, so a FREED op could in
#     principle be replaced at the same address. Within one RHS invocation MLIR
#     ops are only ever appended — erasure and RAUW happen in the pass pipeline,
#     long after the trace has finished — so no op observed by this memo can be
#     freed while the memo is alive. Confining the memo to one invocation is what
#     makes that argument airtight, and `ESS_OOP_INTERN=2` re-checks the recorded
#     value against the live one on every hit (see `_rx_intern_check`).
#
# WHY ONE RHS INVOCATION IS ALSO THE LARGEST SOUND SCOPE. A driver may trace the
# RHS inside a `@trace for` body, which puts those ops in a nested MLIR REGION.
# A value defined in one region does not dominate a use outside it (or in a later
# one), so a memo that outlived the invocation could hand back a value the
# verifier rejects — or, across separate `@compile`s, a value from a dead module.
# The emitter itself opens no region inside one invocation, so every value the
# memo holds is defined in the same block as every use of it. The deeper variant
# — hoisting `ue` windows to PROGRAM scope — is therefore declined here: it is
# exactly the cross-region case this bound excludes.
#
# NUMERICS. Reusing an SSA value for an identical read is a pure emission-time
# CSE. The reused value is the result of the op the duplicate would have emitted,
# with the same operand and the same window, so the consuming ops receive
# bit-identical inputs; the emitted program differs from the non-interned one
# only by the removal of ops with no other effect.

# `Dict` rather than `IdDict`: content-keyed on the slot vector is the point (the
# duplicate descriptors hold DIFFERENT `Vector{Int}` objects with equal
# contents), and `Dict` verifies the key with `isequal` on every hit. `Base`'s
# array hash is sub-linear, so a lookup is cheap even for a large window.
#
# The same object also carries the EMISSION value-numbering tables (ess-oop-gvn;
# see the seam block in tree_walk/oop.jl for why the key is emitted SSA values).
# `gvn == false` leaves them permanently empty.

# ---- Stencil shifts as affine slices (ess-oop-shift-slice) -----------------
#
# `u[slots]` with a host `Vector{Int}` lowers to a `stablehlo.slice` only when
# `slots` is a single constant-stride RUN (`getindex_linear`). A stencil kernel
# class on a 3-D grid reads `out .+ delta` where `out` enumerates a BOX of cells
# (`_oop_acc_lanes`: `Iterators.product` over per-axis ranges with per-axis
# strides), which is a strided box in the flat state, not a run, so it lowers to
# a `stablehlo.gather` carrying a dense index constant. Forward that costs
# little. In REVERSE it is a scatter-add over the same dense indices, which XLA
# executes serially: the transport VJP at CONUS carried 628 of them and cost
# 21.8x its primal step (reseact.esm tools/diag/p5_vjp_time.jl, 2026-09-04).
#
# A strided box is exactly a rectangular window of the state viewed as a
# multi-dimensional array, and the reverse of a slice is a pad, which fuses.
# So when `ESS_OOP_SHIFT_SLICE=1` (read once per RHS call, trace time only),
# a gather whose slots are VERIFIED to be a strided box is emitted as
#   reshape(u[1:need], dims) -> [o0, r1, ..., rk] -> permutedims -> vec
# and anything else (ghost-masked slots, indirect tables, wrapping boxes, a
# stride chain that does not divide) keeps the gather. Verification is by exact
# reconstruction of the slot vector from the detected (base, sizes, strides),
# so a false positive cannot read the wrong cells: the worst case is a gather
# that could have been a slice. Pure data movement, so the primal is bit-for-bit
# what the gather produced; only the adjoint's accumulation ORDER can differ
# (roundoff).

#
# The read memo above removes duplicate READS; this removes duplicate ops. The
# argument for why it is sound, why the key is emitted SSA values rather than
# AST nodes, and why scalar constants are the load-bearing case, is at the
# `_oop_op`/`_oop_const` seams in tree_walk/oop.jl. What lives here is the part
# that needs Reactant: what "the same value" means.
#
# VALUE IDENTITY. An operand's identity is its current MLIR SSA value plus its
# SHAPE — the same `.ref.ptr` handle `mlirValueEqual` compares, the same one the
# read memo keys on, and for the same reason (a `TracedRArray` is a mutable
# NAME for a value, so the Julia object is not it). The shape rides along
# because two results of different shape are never the same tensor, and it
# costs nothing to be explicit.
#
# AN OPERAND WITHOUT AN SSA VALUE DECLINES THE WHOLE OP. A host `Float64`, a
# frozen lane `Vector{Float64}` from an `_OopAccPlan`, a ghost `BitVector`: none
# has a value identity, and the tempting substitute — `objectid` — is exactly the
# unsound one, because those are MUTABLE host containers whose contents can
# differ between two calls with the same address. Rather than reason about which
# host arrays the build promises to freeze, an op with any such operand is
# emitted unmemoized. (Reactant already interns ARRAY constants by value in its
# own entry-block table, so the frozen lane vectors do not duplicate anyway; the
# ops CONSUMING them are the small residue this declines.)

# ---- Native op emission (ess-oop-native) ------------------------------------
#
# WHY. A large share of the raw (`optimize=false`) op count is no-ops:
# `broadcast_in_dim`s whose input and output types are IDENTICAL, `transpose`s
# with identity permutation and identical types, and `constant`s nothing ever
# reads. They are not duplicates for CSE to find; they are scaffolding for XLA's
# canonicalizer to delete, and every pass in the pipeline walks them first.
#
# WHERE THEY COME FROM — Reactant's broadcast lowering, not this emitter's
# arithmetic:
#   * `Reactant.broadcast_to_size(::TracedRArray, rsize)` emits a
#     `broadcast_in_dim` UNCONDITIONALLY, including when `size(arg) == rsize`;
#   * `_copyto!` runs it over every argument, and `Broadcast.Extruded` runs it
#     TWICE (hence the `%b = broadcast_in_dim %a` pairs at identical type);
#   * `Base.materialize` is `copyto!(similar(bc), bc)`, and `similar` on a
#     traced array is `Ops.fill(0, shape)` — a `stablehlo.constant` that
#     `set_mlir_data!` then rebinds away from, leaving it dead;
#   * `promote_to`/`materialize_traced_array` contribute the identity
#     `transpose`.
# So one `a .+ b` over lanes costs ~6 ops where one is wanted.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES. For the four IEEE arithmetic primitives and negation — and
# ONLY those — emit the `stablehlo` op directly through `Reactant.Ops` when the
# operands are already traced values of the same element type and lane shape.
# `Ops.add(a, b)` builds exactly one operation over exactly those two operand
# values.
#
# WHY THE SET IS EXACTLY THESE FIVE, and stops there. `stablehlo.add`,
# `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide` and `negate` on `f64` ARE the IEEE-754
# operations Julia's `+ - * / -` are, on every input including subnormals,
# infinities and NaNs — so substituting them is bit-exact by definition. That is
# NOT true of the tempting next candidates: Julia's
# `max`/`min` propagate NaN and `stablehlo.maximum`/`minimum` are not specified
# to, and `^` has an integer-exponent fast path in Julia that `stablehlo.power`
# does not share. Those keep the broadcast path; the scaffolding they carry is
# the price of a guarantee, and they are a small share of the total anyway.
#
# THE FOLD ORDER IS THE LADDER'S. `_oop_op(:+)` folds LEFT — `((c1+c2)+c3)…` —
# and so does this, term for term, because association order is a numerical
# decision this tier is not allowed to make. Likewise the SCALAR/ARRAY SHAPE of
# every intermediate is preserved: a scalar pair stays a scalar op and a scalar
# is lifted to lane width only where broadcast would have lifted it, so neither
# the emitted widths nor the runtime work change.
#
# OUTCOME. Native emission cuts the RAW op count materially and leaves the
# OPTIMIZED count essentially unchanged — XLA is left holding the same program,
# which is the correctness signal this tier is supposed to produce. It composes
# with value numbering rather than subsuming it: GVN removes whole duplicate ops,
# this removes the scaffolding around the ops that remain. Whether the smaller raw
# program shortens `@compile` is the open question that keeps both OFF by default
# (see `_oop_new_memo`); `ESS_OOP_NATIVE=1` opts in, independently of the others.

# allocates. Under a trace it was the LAST O(grid) surface in this emitter, and
# by a wide margin. Each element costs a `dynamic_slice` + a
# `dynamic_update_slice` (each rewriting the WHOLE extended state tensor) + 4
# index constants + 2 reshapes + a broadcast, so the emitted program grows by
# `2·len` slice ops and `~4·len` constants PER LANE — dozens of ops per grid
# column, and once the per-cell scalar surface was lane-batched (ess-oop-batch),
# the only thing left in this emitter that still scaled with the grid.
#
# The recurrence is sequential along the LEVEL axis only; lanes never read each
# other. So run it level-major: one whole-array gather of level `k` across every
# lane, one broadcast ⊕ into the running lane vector, one whole-array scatter
# back. `len` gathers + `len` scatters, INDEPENDENT of the number of lanes —
# the same "one whole-array op per structural step, never one per cell"
# discipline `_oop_scatter` above is written to.

# term is read from the ORIGINAL `du`: in the scalar loop the read of level `k`
# precedes the write of level `k`, and a fold's slots are pairwise distinct
# state indices, so no read there ever observed a write either. Pinned over

# ---- interp knot addressing: a GATHER, not an O(table) select ladder ---------
#
# The default lowering of `interp.*`'s locate → gather → blend
# (src/tree_walk/oop.jl) is a branch-free SELECT LADDER: one `ifelse` per table
# knot, chained. On host that is the right program — a few fused broadcasts over a
# 2–3 knot table. Under a trace it is O(table) traced OPS PER CALL SITE, so a
# component that interpolates over tables of a few thousand entries emits a
# program dominated by `select`/`compare` scaffolding rather than arithmetic, and
# XLA compile can exhaust host memory.
#
# XLA has the constant-time primitive the ladder is emulating. "Index a constant
# table by a computed integer index" is `stablehlo.gather`; "count how many knots
# are ≤ the query" is a `compare` against a constant knot ROW plus one `reduce`.
# Both are O(1) ops in the TABLE, so the emitted program stops depending on the
# table size at all.
#
# BIT-IDENTITY, which is the acceptance bar (test/tree_walk_oop_test.jl pins the
# lane forms against the scalar `_interp_*_core` kernels over dense query sweeps
# including both clamps and NaN):
#
#   * COUNT. The ladder sums 0.0/1.0 terms left to right; `sum` over the same
#     terms reassociates. Every term is 0.0 or 1.0 and n ≪ 2^53, so every partial
#     sum is an exactly-representable integer and the result is INDEPENDENT of
#     association order. NaN queries fail every compare in both forms and
#     contribute 0.0 in both.
#   * GATHER. The ladder SELECTS `v[k]` when `i == k` — it never blends — so the
#     table entry arrives bit-exact; a gather returns the same stored double.
#     Identical for ±0.0, subnormals, Inf and NaN table entries alike. The index
#     is produced by the callers' `min(max(count,1), n-1)` clamp, so it is an
#     exactly-integral Float64 in `[1, n-1]` and `stablehlo.convert` to i64
#     (round-toward-zero) is exact; the gather is therefore always in bounds and
#     never takes XLA's out-of-bounds clamping path.
#   * The blend, the query clamps and the NaN handling are untouched — they live
#     in the shared lane evaluators, not in these seams.
#
# Both knot SHAPES are served: a `Vector{Float64}` (one table shared by every
# lane) becomes a flat constant indexed by `k` directly; a
# `Vector{Vector{Float64}}` / `Matrix{Vector{Float64}}` of lane COLUMNS (the
# kernel-class merge's `_Interp*LaneSpec`, one table per lane) becomes the same
# flat constant in knot-major order, indexed by `(k-1)*D + gid[lane]` against a
# constant lane→group map — so the merged path gets the identical O(1) lowering,
# with lane `l` still reading only its own table. `D` is the number of DISTINCT
# lane tables rather than the lane count; see the lane-dedup section for why
# that difference is what keeps the constant off the grid size.

# --- lane dedup ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The kernel-class merge tables one spec PER LANE, and a lane
# is (cell × member): merging Fast-JX's 18 actinic-flux bands over a grid gives
# `L = 18 · ncells` lanes. But the bands' tables do not vary with the cell —
# there are 18 DISTINCT tables and `ncells` copies of each. Materialising one
# copy per lane makes the emitted XLA constant scale with the GRID, which is
# precisely the property a compiled program must not have — on a real grid it
# exceeds the size of constant Reactant is willing to emit at all. Keying lanes by
# VALUE makes the constant scale with the number of DISTINCT tables, a property of
# the document rather than of the domain, so it stays flat at every grid.
#
# Grouping is by `isequal` (what `Dict` uses), NOT `==`: it separates `-0.0`
# from `0.0` and unifies `NaN` with `NaN`, so two lanes share a slot only when
# their tables agree BITWISE. Merging is therefore value-preserving by
# construction, and when no two lanes agree the groups degenerate to
# `gid[l] = l` and the emitted constant is byte-for-byte the old one.
#
# RELATION TO BUILD-TIME INTERNING (tree_walk/acc_merge.jl `_lane_intern`).
# Since the lane-table intern pool landed, content-equal `_Interp*Spec`s are
# already the SAME object (`===`) in `h.specs` when these seams run — sharing
# now exists in the build product, not just in the trace. This grouping stays
# anyway, and deliberately so: it is PER COLUMN COLLECTION (the axis columns
# group independently of the table columns), which is strictly FINER than the
# spec-level identity the pool provides — Fast-JX's 18 bands hold 18 distinct
# SPECS but ONE shared axis, so the axis constant dedupes to D = 1 here where
# a spec-identity key would stop at D = 18. The seams also only ever see the
# knot COLUMNS, not `h`, so spec identity is not even observable here. What
# interning did retire is the last O(lanes) constant these seams could not
# reach: the clamp/edge boundary columns are collapsed to scalars host-side by
# `_oop_lane_bound` (oop.jl) before the broadcast, so they never arrive at all.

# --- the three seams ----------------------------------------------------------

# count-locate: `Σ_k [cmp(knots[k], q)]`, WITHOUT a `stablehlo.reduce`.
#
# WHY NOT THE REDUCE. The obvious lowering — broadcast the knot row against the
# query column, select 1.0/0.0, `reduce` along the knot axis — is five ops and was
# the first thing here. Locating elementwise instead has measured faster on the one
# real chemistry mechanism it was compared on, bit-exact against the reduce form,
# for a small increase in emitted ops. That is the whole case for this seam.
#
# It is NOT a fusion-boundary argument. An earlier version of this comment claimed
# reductions were hard fusion boundaries whose removal would collapse the step's
# fusion count; removing every locate reduction moved it by ~2%. Do not cite that
# model here, and do not extend this seam on its strength.
#
# So the count is computed elementwise instead, in one of three tiers. All three
# return the SAME Float64 lane value as the ladder in `tree_walk/oop.jl` — the
# terms are 0.0/1.0 and `n ≪ 2^53`, so every association order is exact, and the
# tiers below only ever ADD exact small integers.
#
#   LADDER (n ≤ `ESS_RX_LOCATE_LADDER_MAX`, default 8). Emit the host chain
#     verbatim: `n` compares against knot CONSTANTS, `n` selects, `n-1` adds.
#     Bit-identical by construction — it IS the reference expression. This is
#     not the O(table) ladder the seam header forbids: it is CAPPED at a few
#     knots. It is also what most real call sites want — photolysis mechanisms
#     interpolate the great majority of their cross-sections and quantum yields
#     over a 2- or 3-point temperature axis, where a reduce reduces two elements.
#
#   AFFINE (larger `n`, when a host-time fit succeeds). A uniform axis locates
#     arithmetically: `g = floor(q·a + b)` is the index, in ~7 elementwise ops,
#     no gather and no reduce. But `g` is NOT exact — for the Fast-JX flux
#     table's `-0.2 : 0.02 : 1.0` axis, `a = 50, b = 11` gives
#     `fl(fl(-0.2·50) + 11) = 0.999999999999998`, so a query sitting exactly ON
#     a knot lands one cell low, and the linear blend then returns
#     `t_{k-1} + 1·(t_k − t_{k-1})` where the reference returns `t_k` — equal in
#     real arithmetic, not in Float64. No choice of `(a, b)` fixes this in
#     general: the map would have to send every knot to an integer EXACTLY, and
#     the neighbouring float to strictly below it, which asks a rounding error
#     of ~1e-16·k to fall the right way n times over.
#
#     So the affine step is used only as a GUESS, and corrected by comparing
#     against the one real knot above it — a single gather of a constant table,
#     which this file already uses for the other two seams. Writing `P(k)` for
#     `cmp(knots[k], q)`, which for a sorted axis is TRUE exactly on the prefix
#     `k ≤ c` (that is the definition of the count `c`, under either `cmp`
#     sense), and `gm = clamp(g, 0, n-1)`:
#
#         c = gm + [P(gm + 1)]
#
#     is EXACT — no guards, at either end — provided the guess `g` (clamped to
#     [0, n]) satisfies the ONE-SIDED bound `0 ≤ c − g ≤ 1`, i.e. it never
#     overshoots and undershoots by at most one:
#       * `0 ≤ g ≤ n-1`, so `gm = g` and `c ∈ {g, g+1}`. `P(g+1)` holds iff
#         `c ≥ g+1`, which is precisely the `c = g+1` case.
#       * `g = n`, so `gm = n-1` and the bound forces `c = n` (`c ≤ n` always).
#         `P(n)` holds, giving `n-1 + 1`.
#     A NaN query is the `g = 0` case by construction (the select below), `P(1)`
#     fails, and the count is 0 — exactly what the ladder gives.
#
#     One-sidedness is what a downward BIAS in `b` buys: on the cell
#     `[knots[c], knots[c+1])` the exact affine map lands `t` in `[c, c+1)`, so
#     rounding can push `floor(t)` to `c+1` at the top of the cell. Subtracting
#     a δ that is huge next to the ~1e-15 rounding error and tiny next to 1
#     removes that side without introducing a second, and `floor(t)` lands on
#     `c` or `c-1`. Real axes so far take δ = 1e-9 or 0.
#
#     None of this is assumed. The bound is VERIFIED on the host, exhaustively,
