# CROSS-SHAPE STATE GATHER: a state array read from a loop of a DIFFERENT shape.
#
# `_AK_STATE_AFFINE` models `u[oln + Δ]` — a gather from an array laid out
# exactly like the output. A gather from an array of a different shape (a
# lower-rank geometry column read from a 2-D/3-D loop, a staggered face field, a
# surface field) has a slot that is still AFFINE in the loop indices, but with
# the array's own strides, so `Δ` moves at every cell. Two things followed, both
# O(#cells):
#
#   * the per-cell cut signature keyed state lanes by `Δ`, so it read a
#     transition at every cell — the edge-inward scan never stabilised and every
#     axis was cut into segments up to the `_AFFINE_MAX_DELTA_SEGS` cap, making
#     the BOX COUNT grow with the grid;
#   * `_derive_lane_repl` then could not prove the lane uniform over its box and
#     materialised a DENSE per-box slot table — one `_eval_recipe` and one stored
#     `Int` per box CELL, per lane.
#
# The fix keys the lane by its own subscripts' deviation from affinity (which is
# identically zero for an affine subscript, at any grid size) and lowers it to
# `_AccStateTblBox` addressed through the variable's own IDENTITY slot block —
# shared across every lane, box and equation of the build.
#
# This pins BOTH halves as grid-independent, and pins numeric equality against
# the two kill switches (`ESS_LANE_AFFINE_KEY_DISABLE=1`, `ESS_STATE_BOX_DISABLE=1`)
# which restore the pre-fix build.
