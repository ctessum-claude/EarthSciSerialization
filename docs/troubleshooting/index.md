- [Performance Problems](performance.md) - Diagnose slow loading or validation
- [Language-Specific Issues](language-specific.md) - Platform and runtime problems

## General Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check the basics**
   - Is your ESM file valid JSON?
   - Does it pass schema validation?
   - Are all required fields present?

2. **Enable debug output**
   - Most libraries have verbose/debug flags
   - Check error messages carefully
   - Look for line numbers in parse errors

3. **Test with minimal examples**
   - Start with simple, working examples
   - Gradually add complexity
   - Use the examples in this documentation

4. **Check version compatibility**
   - Ensure library versions match
   - Check for breaking changes in updates
   - Use compatible ESM format versions
